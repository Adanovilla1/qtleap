<seg id="1">Parliament Does Not Support Amendment Freeing Tymoshenko</seg>
</h1>
<p>
<seg id="2">Today, the Ukraine parliament dismissed, within the Code of Criminal Procedure amendment, the motion to revoke an article based on which the opposition leader, Yulia Tymoshenko, was sentenced.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="3">The amendment that would lead to freeing the imprisoned former Prime Minister was revoked during second reading of the proposal for mitigation of sentences for economic offences.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="4">In October, Tymoshenko was sentenced to seven years in prison for entering into what was reported to be a disadvantageous gas deal with Russia.</seg>
<seg id="5">The verdict is not yet final; the court will hear Tymoshenko's appeal in December.</seg>
<seg id="6">Tymoshenko claims the verdict is a political revenge of the regime; in the West, the trial has also evoked suspicion of being biased.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="7">The proposal to remove Article 365 from the Code of Criminal Procedure, upon which the former Prime Minister was sentenced, was supported by 147 members of parliament.</seg>
<seg id="8">Its ratification would require 226 votes.</seg>

<h1>
<seg id="1">Libya's Victory</seg>
</h1>
<p>
<seg id="2">The story of Libya's liberation, or rebellion, already has its defeated.</seg>
<seg id="3">Muammar Kaddafi is buried at an unknown place in the desert. Without him, the war is over.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="4">It is time to define the winners.</seg>
<seg id="5">As a rule, Islamists win in the country; the question is whether they are the moderate or the radical ones.</seg>
<seg id="6">The transitional cabinet declared itself a follower of the customary Sharia law, of which we have already heard.</seg>
<seg id="7">Libya will become a crime free country, as the punishment for stealing is having one's hand amputated.</seg>
<seg id="8">Women can forget about emancipation; potential religious renegades will be executed; etc.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="9">Instead of a dictator, a society consisting of competing tribes will be united by Koran.</seg>
<seg id="10">Libya will be in an order we cannot imagine and surely would not ask for.</seg>
<seg id="11">However, our lifestyle is neither unique nor the best one and would not, most probably, be suitable for, for example, the people of Libya.</seg>
<seg id="12">In fact, it is a wonder that the Islamic fighters accepted help from the nonbelievers.</seg>
<seg id="13">Their only excuse is that from their point of view, NATO raids were not controlled by an American general, but Allah, the greatness of whom they celebrated with each strike.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="14">When winners are sought for in Libya, the West is not on the list.</seg>
<seg id="15">We participated in a shooting, served Islam, and our politicians got rid of a dictator, their political ally, without any guarantee of profit.</seg>
<seg id="16">Given the recent bad experience from Afghanistan and Iraq, we decided against military occupation of Libya.</seg>
<seg id="17">The locals thus do not have to worry about expelling of the "crusaders."</seg>
<seg id="18">Without the occupation, will the oil companies get Libya's black gold for next to nothing, though?</seg>
<seg id="19">It is quite likely that they will not. The West will then finally be able to boast about its selfless protection of human rights.</seg>
<seg id="20">Unless the followers of the Sharia law put a stop to that.</seg>

<seg id="1">Czechs qualified for EURO.</seg>
<seg id="2">In Montenegro they won 1:0 and celebrate a 200 million windfall.</seg>
</h1>
<p>
<seg id="3">Football representation successfully managed the toughest task of the season!</seg>
<seg id="4">Thanks to both the great Čech and beautiful goal of Petr Jiráček ,they won 1:0.</seg>
<seg id="5">In the second half, Czech football was lucky to maintain its luxury lead from the home return match, and will again feature at the European Championship.</seg>
<seg id="6">IHNED.cz watched the progress match in a detailed report.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="7">Nearly no excitement in the first half, and a great portion of luck in the other.</seg>
<seg id="8">Czech representation team, partially due to the home team's failure in the close; the great Čech; and heroic Jiráček; won 1:0 in Montenegro, and celebrates moving on to the European Championship.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="9">Perfect Czech team defence only allowed the Montenegro team to threaten in the second half.</seg>
<seg id="10">Damjanovic and Vucinic became the match's least lucky couple after losing two great opportunities.</seg>
<seg id="11">The wonderful Petr Čech is one of the reasons the Czech representation team will not miss the next year's European Championship. And Czech football will thus gain nearly 200 million Czech Crowns.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="12">From the opening minutes, the game was very pugnacious.</seg>
<seg id="13">Both teams found it difficult to join in the combination; the game remained around the mid-field line most of the time.</seg>
<seg id="14">That was also why there was no pressure from the home team in the first half. Long kicks behind the defence were neatly averted by the Czech defence.</seg>

<p>
<seg id="8">In its recent report, the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) stated that everything leads to the conclusion that Iran has not stopped striving for a nuclear weapon.</seg>

<seg id="1">An Obese Child's Diet: No breakfast and sausage for dinner</seg>
</h1>
<p>
<seg id="2">Over a third of children between 9 and 13 are overweight; while 9% of schoolchildren are overweight, 5% are obese.</seg>
<seg id="3">As a recent research shows, obese children usually come from families with unhealthy lifestyle.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="4">Again, we can see the importance of the environment and models surrounding a human being for his or her healthy development.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="5">For example, sausages occur up to half more frequently on the tables of obese children compared to the families of children with standard weight.</seg>
<seg id="6">Over 19% of obese children had fried chips for dinner the day before the research connected to the educational event called Obesity is No Accident.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="7">Moreover, the families of obese children do not practise sports. However, this concerns a majority of families of current schoolchildren - only 15% of the children said their parents find time for sports activities at least once a week.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="8">The research was performed among 900 children.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="9">The research took place at the end of last year's school year; it included almost 900 elementary school children from throughout Bohemia.</seg>
<seg id="10">It was the second year of the Obesity is No Accident event supported by both Všeobecná zdravotní pojišťovna insurance company and Unilever.</seg>
<seg id="11">So far, the project has been joined by over 12 thousand school children from 4th to 8th grades.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="12">Proper diet and sufficient sports activities represent key defining factors causing dramatically growing number of children who are either overweight or obese.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="13">"For example, only half of those inquired said they have five meals a day, in the breakfast-snack-lunch-snack-dinner pattern, one of the basic preconditions of correct diet," one of the results of the research says.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="14">No lunch and sausage in the evening</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="15">Experts warn that even relative details are crucial for healthy development; such as a regular time of family breakfast.</seg>
<seg id="16">In the Czech Republic, only 23% of schoolchildren's families have breakfast together.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="17">In a majority of families, everyone has breakfast separately.</seg>
<seg id="18">The worst discovery was the fact that in one tenth of households people do not have breakfast at all.</seg>
<seg id="19">Yet breakfast is the core of proper daily diet.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="20">A survey has shown that fries are consumed more often in the families of obese children.</seg>
<seg id="21">Nearly everyone - regardless of their weight - drinks sweet soft drinks every day (70%).</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="22">Though over 40% of children do sports regularly, the number drops down to less than a half - 15% - when it comes to their parents.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="23">Compose your own menu</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="24">Another part of the survey allowed selected children (204 boys and 172 girls from 13 schools) to compose their own menu based on selection offered and their taste and opinions.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="25">"Diet preferences of Czech children between 12 and 15 are far from ideal as regards healthy diet."</seg>
<seg id="26">Their favourite meals include large number of flour, meat, and sweet dishes.</seg>
<seg id="27">"Especially alarming is the high popularity of sweet soft drinks," the final report of the survey concludes.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="28">As the main dish for lunch, pasta won very tightly over poultry.</seg>
<seg id="29">However, children showed very little interest in legumes, fish, and vegetable lunches.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="30">Tendency towards health</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="31">The survey also showed that children are willing to adjust their eating habits provided they are given correct information.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="32">"Many participants from the survey control group showed a significant shift of preferences towards healthy food when completing a questionnaire after the end of the Obesity is No Accident educational lecture," project results show.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="33">This was quite significant, for example, in case of sweet soft drinks, where more children would begin to prefer plain water.</seg>
<seg id="34">In addition, for their main course, children ticked poultry and fish more often, limiting sweet meals and dumplings.</seg>
