Shaw cursed himself under his breath for not starting here.
They certainly don't make them like they used to, he mused.
A figure wearing a derby hat with a yellowed newspaper covering his features was sprawled in a red velvet revolving chair.
One was dressed in what Shaw identified as an English-cut coat and trousers.
The other wore a tropical worsted suit.
Almost as if he was afraid of waking its owner, Shaw painstakingly removed the case from under the rigid fingers.
Suddenly he froze.
Out of the corner of his eye he thought he caught an imperceptible movement.
But it had to be an illusion.
The wavering shadows on the walls were causing his inborn fears to run wild.
If it was left to his imagination, the feeble light could make anything come alive.
Then his heart stopped.
A cardiologist would say that's impossible.
But his heart stopped as he stared paralyzed at a reflection in the window.
Behind him, the cadaver with the derby in the revolving chair was straightening to a stiff-backed position.

Commission Regulation (EC) No 549/2009
of 24 June 2009
amending Regulation (EC) No 214/2001 laying down detailed rules for the application of Council Regulation (EC) No 1255/1999 as regards intervention on the market in skimmed milk powder
THE COMMISSION OF THE EUROPEAN COMMUNITIES,
Having regard to the Treaty establishing the European Community,
Having regard to Council Regulation (EC) No 1234/2007 of 22 October 2007 establishing a common organisation of agricultural markets and on specific provisions for certain agricultural products (Single CMO Regulation), and in particular Article 43(d), in conjunction with Article 4 thereof,
Article 10(1)(f) of Regulation (EC) No 1234/2007 provides for public intervention of skimmed milk powder.
Commission Regulation (EC) No 214/2001 has laid down the detailed rules concerning the public intervention on the market in skimmed milk powder.
In view of the current and foreseeable market situation characterised by low prices on dairy products and in particular skimmed milk powder, combined with difficulties to obtain commercial credits for normal dairy operations, it is appropriate to advance the payment for selling skimmed milk powder into intervention.
The current payment period of 120–140 days should therefore be reduced to 45–65 days thereby providing a harmonisation of all payment periods for intervention products in the dairy sector.
Regulation (EC) No 214/2001 should be amended accordingly.
The measures provided for in this Regulation are in accordance with the opinion of the Management Committee for the Common Organisation of Agricultural Markets,
HAS ADOPTED THIS REGULATION:
Article 1
Regulation (EC) No 214/2001 is amended as follows:
When he peeked into Donald's room he found the man was wide awake.
"I feel terrible," Donald said.
"I haven't slept all night."
"What's the problem?" David asked, feeling his pulse quicken.
To David's dismay, the complaints were disturbingly familiar: crampy abdominal pain along with nausea and diarrhea.
In addition, just like Jonathan, he complained of having to swallow continually.
David tried to remain calm.
He spoke with Donald for almost half an hour, asking detailed questions about each complaint and ascertaining the sequence in which the complaints had appeared.
Donald had been initially diagnosed as having pancreatic cancer, but surgery had proved this not to be the case.
He'd undergone a massive operation called a Whipple procedure which included the removal of his pancreas, parts of his stomach and intestines, and a good deal of lymphatic tissue.
When pathology examined the tumor it had been determined to be benign.
Since he had had such extensive surgery on his digestive system, but had not had chemotherapy to compromise his immune system, David was hopeful that Donald's complaints were purely functional and not harbingers of whatever afflicted David's other unlucky patients.
After finishing his rounds, David called admitting to find out Caroline's room number.
On his way he had to pass the ICU.
Steeling himself against what he might learn, he went in to check on Jonathan Eakins.
I'm going with you.
Let me go, goddamn it!
Son of a bitch.
You're not letting me go, are ya?
You're never coming back, you goddamn bastard!
Don't leave me alone!
Open the damn door!
I've been waiting for you.
He has to be in there.
I'm sorry, Daddy but we had to.
Oh, my God.
Jody?
Come on.
There's this door down here and I'll bet there's something behind it.
Let's take a look then.
Interim injunction:
Article 156 of the Code of Civil Procedure regulates the interim injunction, the objective of which is to ensure immediate legal protection to prevent the impairment of rights that, due to the lapse of time, cannot be remedied ex post.
By ordering an interim injunction the court obliges the adversary of the applicant to comply at a time when it has not yet come to a decision on the substance of the legal dispute between the parties.
Contrary to the general rules, the court adjudicates on the application in advance and the ruling ordering the interim injunction may be executed in advance irrespective of the appeals procedure.
The request may be put forward only in a court action, the earliest date being the time when the application is submitted.
The applicant under law does not have to prove that the information presented is true beyond doubt, but only that it is probable.
There is only a limited possibility for verification while the measure is in operation; it may only be allowed if the application cannot be decided without it.
The reason for the restriction is the objective of the interim injunction and the fact that the party only has to show that the situation is possible, without verifying that the conditions for the applications are definitely met.
The trial court, when arriving at a decision, has to consider whether the party has shown that the legal conditions justifying the ordering of an interim injunction are probably met.
The court is also free to decide what degree of probability it requires the party to show.
If the application meets these conditions, the court must assess the disadvantages caused by the interim injunction and compare them with the advantages that can be achieved.
Although the Act uses the expression 'disadvantage caused' it actually means not the disadvantage already caused but the disadvantage that may be caused by the injunction and its implementation.
If the assessment reveals that the disadvantages exceed the advantages, the application has to be rejected.
The court also decides at the time of the assessment whether it requires a security to be lodged for the interim injunction.
The court decides by way of order on the application for interim injunction.
Article 2 Measures against Dryocosmus kuriphilus Yasumatsu The introduction into and spread within the Community of Dryocosmus kuriphilus Yasumatsu, hereinafter referred to as "the organism", shall be prohibited.
Article 3 Import of plants Plants may be introduced into the Community only if:
(a) they comply with the measures laid down in point 1 of Annex I, and (b) they are, on entry into the Community, inspected for the presence of the organism, in accordance with Article 13a(1) of Directive 2000/29/EC, and found free from it.
Article 4 Movement of plants within the Community Without prejudice to the provisions of Article 5(3)(a) and Annex II, Part II, plants originating in the Community or imported into the Community pursuant to Article 3 of this Decision may only be moved from their place of production in the Community, including, where appropriate, garden centres, if they meet the conditions laid down in point 2 of Annex I.
Without prejudice to Article 16(2) of Directive 2000/29/EC, the results of those surveys shall be notified to the Commission and to the other Member States by 31 December of each year.
3. (a) Member States may require that the movement into or within their territory of plants, is subject to a traceability system, which may include a declaration of movement to the responsible official bodies by the person responsible for the movement.
