The treelet dictionary is applied on transfer and allows to translate
non-isomorphic treelets. Furthermore, as the translation is made on
the t-level, the resulting target nodes go through the whole synthesis
allowing both reordering and morphologic generation. For Spanish, we
get a 2 BLEU-point improvement when incorporating the Microsoft
Terminology dictionary this way.

As the dictionary is applied at t-level, all the dictionary entries
have to be analyzed up to this level. To do that, download the
terminology dictionary for your language pair
(https://www.microsoft.com/Language/en-US/Terminology.aspx), and adapt
the en-es or en-eu Makefiles to your language. Once the .streex files
are created, copy both .tbx and .streex to the 'share' directory and
add the 'T2T::TrLApplyTbxDictionary' block to your transfer
scenario. The block needs the location of both the .tbx and .streex
files, as well as the language codes used in those
files. Additionally, the block allows to define blacklists of
dictionary entries that have to be ignored. Specifically, the
parameters used on the En2Es scenario are:

'T2T::TrLApplyTbxDictionary tbx=data/dictionaries/MicrosoftTermCollection.es.tbx tbx_src_id=en-US tbx_trg_id=es-es analysis=data/dictionaries/MicrosoftTermCollection.es.streex analysis_src_language=en analysis_src_selector=src analysis_trg_language=es analysis_trg_selector=trg src_blacklist=data/dictionaries/MicrosoftTermCollection.en-es.src.blacklist.txt'

Depending on the size of the dictionary, the loading time of the block
can be long. On the other hand, the transfer time is not too slow.
