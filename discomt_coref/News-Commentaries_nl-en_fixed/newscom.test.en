Europe’s Trust Deficit
BERKELEY – There is no shortage of talk nowadays about Europe’s deficits and the need to correct them.
Critics point to governments’ gaping budget deficits.
They cite the southern European countries’ chronic external deficits.
They highlight the eurozone’s institutional deficits – a single currency and a central bank but none of the other elements of a well-functioning monetary union.
Of course, in all of these areas, the critics have a point.
But none of these is the deficit that really matters.
The deficit that prevents Europe from drawing a line under its crisis is a deficit of trust.
First, there is deficient trust between national leaders and their publics.
We saw this most visibly in the person of former Italian Prime Minister Silvio Berlusconi, who fortunately has been kicked to the sidelines of the political scene.
But even the most stalwart European leaders have lost their followers’ trust by baldly saying one thing today and the opposite tomorrow.
At the end of February, for example, German Chancellor Angela Merkel made a spectacle insisting that no bigger financial firewall was needed to protect other eurozone countries from a disorderly Greek default.
Not one more euro of German taxpayer money, she vowed, would be contributed for this purpose.
Yet everyone knew that once the Bundestag voted for the latest Greek rescue and enough time passed to acknowledge reality gracefully, Merkel would reverse course and argue that the eurozone needed a bigger firewall after all.
In fact, there is nothing at all graceful about this.
For politicians to say one thing now when everyone knows they will soon say the opposite is guaranteed to erode trust in Europe’s leaders.
Second, there is a lack of trust among European Union member states.
The real reason why the northern Europeans have been unwilling to provide a “big bazooka” – that is, extend more financial assistance to Southern Europe – is that they don’t trust the beneficiaries to use it wisely.
They fear, for example, that additional securities purchases by the European Central Bank, aimed at bringing down Spain’s borrowing costs, would only lead the Spanish government to relax its reform effort.
As a result, Germany and its allies are prepared to provide just enough assistance to keep the ship from capsizing, but not enough to set it on an even keel.
Third, there is lack of trust among the social groups called on to make sacrifices.
Italian taxi drivers would be prepared to allow more competition if they were sure that Italian pharmacy owners were willing to do likewise.
But if issuing more taxi medallions reduces cab drivers’ earnings, while pharmacists succeed in vetoing pro-competition measures to lower the cost of their services, the taxi drivers will end up worse off and the pharmacists will be enriched, which hardly seems fair.
In other words, lack of social trust blocks structural reform.
The Greek version of this dilemma, in which no one pays taxes because no one else pays taxes, is particularly stark.
Survey research has revealed that societies vary greatly in their levels of trust.
Economists, for their part, have shown that these different attitudes have deep historical roots.
In European regions where minority groups were persecuted 500 years ago, ethnic and religious conflicts have been more pervasive in recent times.
In parts of the Balkans long ruled by the Ottoman Empire, trust in government is lower than in nearby regions that just happened to have been ruled by the more efficient Habsburgs.
In regions where earlier inhabitants engaged in farming rather than herding, forcing them to cooperate more extensively, their descendants are more likely to form bonds of trust today.
Evidently, attitudes are passed down through the generations. They are embedded in societies in the form of culture.
Simply put, when it comes to trust, history casts a long shadow.
Historians have long emphasized the importance of such “path dependence” – that events in the distant past continue to shape outcomes in the present.
Yet they also point to exceptional windows in time when it is possible for societies to shift away from their established paths.
A crisis, when the viability of established arrangements is called into question, is just such a window.
The euro crisis thus offers Europe an opportunity to reestablish trust.
Its national leaders need to reestablish the trust of their constituents by offering them straight talk.
EU member states need to rebuild their trust in one another.
And European countries facing the need for wrenching structural reforms need to restore social trust at home.
If this opportunity to rebuild trust is squandered, it will be difficult, if not impossible, for Europe to address its fiscal, economic, and institutional deficits.

The Resource Hope
WASHINGTON, DC – When a country quadruples its tax revenues in a single year, it is time to take notice.
That is the scale of the revenue increase that Ghana achieved from 2010 to 2011, owing to receipts from its extractive industries.
Ghana is not alone.
Resource-rich developing countries’ rising tax revenues reflect not only higher commodity prices, but also international rules that have improved financial transparency in the oil, gas, and mining industries, reducing opportunities for tax evasion significantly.
Such rules also featured high on the agenda of the recent G-8 Summit in Northern Ireland.
It is important to appreciate these efforts – and to demand more.
International commodity markets are under stress.
Since 2000, prices have been on an upward trajectory, with soaring demand only briefly interrupted by the 2008 financial crisis.
One apparent consequence is extreme price volatility.
Simultaneously, incentives to enter illegal markets are becoming stronger: roughly 20% of the world market in coltan – a precious metal used in mobile communications – is illegally traded.
More financial transparency is an important step toward better markets and good governance in resource-rich countries, because it means less corruption, fraud, and tax evasion, as well as greater public participation and stronger democratic institutions.
Moreover, fair contracts can stabilize income for producer countries.
Indeed, a robust extractive industry and investment in sustainable development would boost economic prospects for the 100 or so resource-rich developing countries and their roughly 3.5 billion people.
Early milestones in this effort have been impressive.
For example, the Extractive Industries Transparency Initiative recently improved its global standard by requiring disclosure of corporate payments and government revenues.
Currently, 23 countries are EITI-compliant, including Azerbaijan, Ghana, Iraq, Nigeria and Norway; non-compliant countries’ memberships have been suspended.
The reported payments total around $1 trillion.
Likewise, Section 1504 of the United States’ 2010 Dodd-Frank Act contains rules on transparency in the extractive industry.
Companies engaged in the commercial development of oil, natural gas, or minerals must submit annual reports to the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) disclosing payments to governments.
More recently, the European Parliament earlier this month approved ambitious new transparency rules for the extractive industry (including the forestry sector).
With the OECD and the International Monetary Fund, along with many NGOs and voluntary companies, supporting such rules, opponents – such as the American Petroleum Institute, which has filed a lawsuit against the SEC – are unlikely to succeed.
In fact, transparency in the resource sector should exceed mere disclosure of payments.
Of course, non-compliance remains a significant challenge.
It is encouraging that Russia has signed the G-8’s Lough Erne Declaration on transparency in extractive-industry payments;but major emerging economies’ global market power could continue to hamper international coordination.
More important, achieving good governance in emerging economies and developing countries demands a properly functioning fiscal system, legislation that supports a sustainable mining industry, and “inclusive” institutions that promote transparency, participation, and equitable development.
Regarding resource use, the challenges lie primarily in the global resource nexus – that is, the interaction between the various resources required to produce fuel and energy feedstock, industrial inputs, and food.
The much-discussed energy-water-food nexus applies to mineral resources and land use as well, forcing extractive industries to address it.
According to the G-8 declaration, land transactions should be transparent and respect local communities’ rights, which include water and food security.
Stronger coordination and leadership on financial transparency and resource use are required, supported by the prospect of reducing dependence on development aid and increasing revenues in resource-rich developing countries.
In particular, all financial transactions related to upstream activities in the value chain should be disclosed, including those carried out by state-owned companies and sovereign wealth funds. Downstream, the international markets for recycling and disposal should be included.
This would also help to increase resource efficiency. 
The next step would be to extend transparency to related contracts and public budgets, as well as coordinated efforts to reach out to emerging economies.
As for sustainable resource management, the EITI’s stakeholder process could become a powerful tool for promoting national action plans.
Similarly, an open, international data portal on resource use should be established to compile core data collected by geological agencies and organizations such as the United Nations Food and Agriculture Organization and the International Energy Agency, as well as data on environmental pressures from resource use and coefficients for resource-intensive areas of production.
Moreover, resource-rich developing countries could introduce extraction taxes and support new fiscal systems that promote high labor standards, poverty reduction, education, research, and innovation.
Key flanking initiatives at the international level could include a multi-stakeholder forum for sustainable resource use and an international metal covenant to promote recycling and material-flow management with industry involvement.
Over the longer term, the aim should be to conclude an international agreement on resource management.
Notwithstanding resource-rich developing countries’ positive prospects, the sustainable management of natural resources, like efforts to promote financial transparency, requires global coordination.

The Changing of the Monetary Guard
NEW YORK – With leadership transitions at many central banks either under way or coming soon, many of those who were partly responsible for creating the global economic crisis that erupted in 2008 – before taking strong action to prevent the worst– are departing to mixed reviews.
The main question now is the extent to which those review swill influence their successors’ behavior.
Many financial-market players are grateful for the regulatory laxity that allowed them to reap enormous profits before the crisis, and for the generous bailouts that helped them to recapitalize – and often to walk off with mega-bonuses – even as they brought the global economy to near-ruin.
True, easy money did help to restore equity prices, but it might also have created new asset bubbles.
Meanwhile, GDP in many European countries remains markedly below pre-crisis levels.
In the United States, despite GDP growth, most citizens are worse-off today than they were before the crisis, because income gains since then have gone almost entirely to those at the top.
In short, many central bankers who served in the heady pre-crisis years have much to answer for.
Given their excessive belief in unfettered markets, they turned a blind eye to palpable abuses, including predatory lending, and denied the existence of an obvious bubble.
Instead, central bankers focused single-mindedly on price stability, though the costs of somewhat higher inflation would have been miniscule compared to the havoc wrought by the financial excesses that they allowed, if not encouraged.
The world has paid dearly for their lack of understanding of the risks of securitization, and, more broadly, their failure to focus on leverage and the shadow banking system.
Of course, not all central bankers are to blame.
It was no accident that countries like Australia, Brazil, Canada, China, India, and Turkey avoided financial crisis; their central bankers had learned from experience – their own or others’– that unfettered markets are not always efficient or self-regulating.
For example, when Malaysia’s central-bank governor supported the imposition of capital controls during the East Asian crisis of 1997-1998, the policy was scorned, but the former governor has since been vindicated.
Malaysia had a shorter downturn, and emerged from the crisis with a smaller legacy of debt.
Even the International Monetary Fund now recognizes that capital controls may be useful, especially in times of crisis.
Such lessons are most obviously relevant to the current competition to succeed Ben Bernanke as Chair of the US Federal Reserve Board, the world’s most powerful monetary authority.
The Fed has two main responsibilities: macro-level regulation aimed at ensuring full employment, output growth, and price and financial stability; and micro-level regulation aimed at financial markets.
The two are intimately connected: micro-level regulation affects the supply and allocation of credit – a crucial determinant of macroeconomic activity.
The Fed’s failure to fulfill its responsibilities for micro-level regulation has much to do with its failure to meet macro-level goals.
Any serious candidate for Fed chairman should understand the importance of good regulation and the need to return the US banking system to the business of providing credit, especially to ordinary Americans and small and medium-size businesses (that is, those who cannot raise money on capital markets).
Sound economic judgment and discretion are required as well, given the need to weigh the risks of alternative policies and the ease with which financial markets can be roiled.
(That said, the US cannot afford a Fed chairman who is overly supportive of the financial sector and unwilling to regulate it.)
Given the certainty of divisions among officials on the relative importance of inflation and unemployment, a successful Fed chairman must also be able to work well with people of diverse perspectives.
But the next leader of the Fed should be committed to ensuring that America’s unemployment rate falls below its current unacceptably high level; an unemployment rate of 7% – or even 6% –should not be viewed as inevitable.
Some people argue that what America needs most is a central banker who has “experienced” crises firsthand.
But what matters is not just “being there” during a crisis, but showing good judgment in managing it.
Those in the US Treasury who were responsible for managing the East Asian crisis performed miserably, converting downturns into recessions and recessions into depressions.
So, too, those responsible for managing the 2008 crisis cannot be credited with creating a robust, inclusive recovery.
Botched efforts at mortgage restructuring, failure to restore credit to small and medium-size enterprises, and the mishandling of bank bailouts have all been well documented, as have major flaws in forecasting both output and unemployment as the economy went into free-fall.
Even more important for a central banker managing a crisis is a commitment to measures that make another crisis less likely.
By contrast, a laissez-faire approach would make another crisis all but inevitable.
A top contender to succeed Bernanke is Fed Vice Chair Janet Yellen, one of my best students when I taught at Yale.
She is an economist of great intellect, with a strong ability to forge consensus, and she has proved her mettle as Chair of the President’s Council of Economic Advisers, President of the San Francisco Fed, and in her current role.
Yellen brings to bear an understanding not just of financial markets and monetary policy, but also of labor markets –which is essential in an era when unemployment and wage stagnation are primary concerns.
(A classic article that she co-authored remains, many years later, on my list of required reading for Ph.D. students.)
Given the fragile economic recovery and the need for continuity in policy – as well as for confidence in the Fed’s leadership and global cooperation based on mutual understanding and respect – Yellen’s steady hand is precisely what US policy making requires.
President Barack Obama is supposed to appoint senior officials with the “advice and consent” of the US Senate.
Roughly one-third of Democratic senators have reportedly written to Obama in support of Yellen.
He should heed their counsel.

The Iranian Message
MADRID – The Iranian people have spoken, and their voice has been heard.
More than 70% of eligible voters turned out to elect the most moderate of the eight presidential candidates approved by the Guardian Council, the body that, among other things, vets candidates for public office.
Hassan Rowhani’s unexpected first-round victory could open doors, both for diplomacy and for Iran’s sanctions-ravaged economy.
This opening is important, but the potential for change that comes with Rowhani’s victory is no means limitless or certain.
After all, Iran’s president does not stand alone at the head of his country.
Still, the election’s outcome is a strong and hopeful signal, and Iran’s international negotiating partners must pay proper attention and react in kind.
The mood in Tehran this weekend could not have been more different from the last election in 2009.
In Iran, as elsewhere, the street is the country’s best social barometer, and Iran’s 75 million inhabitants – frustrated with sky-high inflation and economic hardship – saw reason to celebrate.
After hand-picking the eight candidates from among almost 700 who sought to run (notably discarding reformist former President Akbar Hashemi Rafsanjani and President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad’s protégé Esfandiar Mashaei), Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Hosseini Khamenei carefully allowed his country to speak.
The shape of Rowhani’s victory is important: with 18.6 million of the 36.7 million votes cast, Iran’s former chief nuclear negotiator defeated the six conservative candidates decisively.
But he was far from being a front-runner at the start.
Many were convinced that Saeed Jalili, Iran’s current chief nuclear negotiator, would win, consolidating Khamenei’s hardline rule across the government.
But the centrist-reformist axis swung into action with pinpoint timing.
In the week before the vote, both former President Mohammad Khatami and Rafsanjani publically endorsed Rowhani.
Three days before the election, the only other candidate in the moderate camp, Mohammad Reza Aref, dropped out of the race at Khatami’s request.
With the centrist and reformist camps united behind him, Rowhani surged to victory.
In the presidential debates, which I followed closely, Rowhani – himself a cleric – advocated a rebalancing of international relations and better economic management at home.
With their vote, Iranians sent a strong message of support for that pragmatic agenda, overwhelmingly rejecting Ahmadinejad’s policy of resistance and giving priority to restoring the economy over the pursuit of national glory.
In his post-election press conference, Rowhani reiterated his promise to recalibrate Iran’s relations with the world.
He promised greater openness and to repair the country’s international standing, offering greater nuclear transparency in order to restore international trust.
Clearly, on the nuclear issue, a return to the situation in 2003 is impossible.
The offer that was on the table when I last sat across from Rowhani is no longer available.
But, with his victory, Iran has taken a step forward; it is now up to its negotiating partners to recognize that this is the best chance for diplomatic progress in at least four years, and to make a similar move.
Obviously, it would be senseless to forget that the Supreme Leader remains firmly in control of the nuclear issue.
But, by accepting Rowhani’s victory, Khamenei may have sent a hint, if not a clear signal, that a change of course may be afoot.
It remains to be seen how this would be translated into practice: the true question is how much leeway Khamenei will grant Rowhani, who, like any leader, will be tugged from many sides in his foreign-policy endeavors.
Particularly on the nuclear issue, which, for Iranian diplomacy, dominates most others, Rowhani must walk a political tightrope.
Slowly but surely, lines of communication – between Iran and the United States in particular – must be reestablished.
But a window has opened for both sides.
Through careful diplomacy and precisely measured incentives, some rapprochement is feasible.
As we know, such an opportunity is rare, and it must be seized, given the peril that the nuclear issue poses in Iran’s incendiary neighborhood.
But there is a further international question that cannot go unasked, concerning the role of Iran’s regional proxies.
Though Rowhani will not have sole decision-making power on this issue, he will have to face it squarely if his plan is truly to recalibrate Iran’s international relations.
The question that Rowhani must answer can be put as follows: What is Iran’s vocation?
Is it willing to act as a responsible regional actor, taking its place in negotiations on the serious problems in its neighborhood?
Or will it continue to pursue its interests through its violent, destabilizing proxies in Lebanon, Iraq, and Syria?
I know Rowhani to be a rational and reasonable man, and I am hopeful that meaningful international dialogue can be started.
Though efforts to chart a new diplomatic path will meet opposition and resistance from hard-liners at home, the international community should trust the Iranian people and listen to the message that they have sent.
It is time to send a message back, by opening constructive, incentive-based channels of communication that enable the international community to achieve a safe resolution of the nuclear issue – and that enable Iran’s leaders to focus on the economic recovery and growth that their people demand.

Has Austerity Failed in Europe?
BRUSSELS – Although many European governments have announced expenditure cuts and tax hikes, their debt/GDP ratios continue to deteriorate.
So, if the purpose of austerity was to reduce debt levels, its critics are right: fiscal belt-tightening has failed.
But the goal of austerity was not just to stabilize debt ratios.
In fact, austerity has worked as advertised in some cases.
Germany’s fiscal deficit temporarily increased by about 2.5 percentage points of GDP during the global recession of 2009; subsequent rapid deficit reduction had no significant negative impact on growth.
So it is possible to reduce deficits and keep the debt/GDP ratio in check – provided that the economy does not start out with large imbalances, and that the financial system is working properly.
Obviously, the countries on the eurozone’s periphery do not meet these conditions.
Countries whose governments have either lost access to normal market financing (like Greece, Ireland, and Portugal), or face very high risk premia (like Italy and Spain in 2011-2012) simply do not have a choice: they must reduce their expenditures or get financing from some official body like the International Monetary Fund or the European Stability Mechanism (ESM).
But foreign official financing will always be subject to lenders’ conditions – and lenders see no reason to finance ongoing spending at levels that previously led a country into trouble.
So, in the eurozone periphery, austerity is not a question of fine-tuning demand, but of ensuring governments’ solvency.
Economists like to point out that solvency has little to do with the ratio of public debt to today’s GDP, and much to do with debt relative to expected future tax revenues.
A government’s solvency thus depends much more on long-term growth prospects than on the current debt/GDP ratio.
A reduction in the deficit today might lead in the short run to a fall in GDP that is larger than the cut in the deficit (if the so-called multiplier is larger than one), which would cause the debt/GDP ratio to rise.
But almost all economic models imply that a cut in expenditures today should lead to higher GDP in the long run, because it allows for lower taxes (and thus reduces economic distortions).
Austerity should thus always be beneficial for solvency in the long run, even if the debt/GDP ratio deteriorates in the short run.
For this reason, the current increase in debt/GDP ratios in southern Europe should not be interpreted as proof that austerity does not work.
Moreover, austerity has been accompanied by structural reforms, which should increase countries’ long-term growth potential, while pension reforms are set to reduce considerably the fiscal cost of aging populations.
Such&amp; reforms promise to strengthen the solvency of all governments that adopt them, including those on the eurozone’s periphery.
More important, austerity has been very successful in restoring external balance to the eurozone’s periphery.
The current accounts of all southern eurozone countries are improving rapidly and, with the possible exception of Greece, will soon swing into surplus.
This fundamental change has contributed to the reduction in risk premia over the last year, despite the political upheaval that continues in many countries (particularly Italy, Portugal, and Greece).
The external aspect is crucial.
If public debt is owed to domestic investors, it can be serviced with the taxes levied on GDP.
But debt owed to foreigners can be serviced only with good sand services sold abroad – that is, exports.
Thus, the key variable for countries that had large current-account deficits, and thus are burdened today with high foreign-debt levels, is not the debt/GDP ratio, but the foreign debt/exports ratio (together with the growth prospects for exports).
Here, developments are encouraging.
During the boom years, when countries like Greece, Portugal, and Spain were running ever-larger external deficits, their exports did not grow quickly, so their foreign debt/exports ratios deteriorated steadily, reaching levels that are usually regarded as a warning signal.
For example, for Spain and Portugal, the sum of past deficits relative to annual exports reached 300% and 400%, respectively, in 2009, whereas a 250% ratio is typically regarded as the threshold at which external-financing problems can arise.
With austerity, imports have crashed everywhere in the periphery, while exports – helped by falling labor costs – are increasing (except in Greece).
As a result, these countries’ current accounts are now moving into surplus, and their external solvency is improving rapidly.
Indeed, according to the IMF, Spain should record growing current-account surpluses over the next five years, as exports rise strongly, thus cutting the external debt/export ratio by half (to about 150% in 2018), while Portugal’s ratio should fall to about 250%.
Even Italy, whose external deficits have remained small, will soon record a current-account surplus.
Austerity always involves huge social costs; but it is unavoidable when a country has lived beyond its means and lost its foreign creditors’ confidence. The external fundamentals of the eurozone’s periphery are now improving rapidly.
In this sense, austerity has done exactly what it was intended to do.

Health Care’s New Frontier
BEIJING – Developing countries face a seemingly insurmountable hurdle in providing health care to their rapidly growing – or, in some cases, rapidly aging – populations, especially as health systems become increasingly over-burdened and infections and other diseases spread.
Because access to medicine in these regions is a multifaceted challenge, it is best tackled by several parties.
Lasting, collaborative relationships among pharmaceutical companies, governments, nonprofit organizations, and community leaders are needed to help disadvantaged populations overcome their health-care challenges.
Together, these parties should take a binary approach, addressing both “hardware” factors (which remain constant, such as physical distance to treatment centers and elongated supply chains) and “software” factors (the intangibles that vary greatly in each region, such as the role of family and cultural beliefs).
These principles are especially true in places like China’s rural Xinjiang province, where life expectancy is stunted at 67 years (compared to 73.5 for China as a whole), and lack of access to health care undermines well-being.
Xinjiang covers nearly 650,000 square miles (1.7 million square kilometers), but it is home to only 21 million people, many of whom are members of nomadic tribes.
From an economic standpoint, Xinjiang’s resilience is crucial to China’s economic growth strategy – it is seen as the country’s gateway to the west.
But the reality is that maintaining the livelihood and well-being of this area’s population and those in other rural parts of China is a serious challenge.
Throughout rural China, the spread of infectious diseases –particularly hepatitis B, which affects millions – reflects a lack of hygiene education.
The health ministry cited a 9.5% increase in deaths caused by infectious diseases from 2011 to 2012.
Moreover, there is a serious shortage of health-care workers – just 1.3 per 1,000 rural inhabitants in China.
Free medicines are only part of the solution.
We need to go beyond donations and reduced-pricing schemes to build sustainable health-care systems with strong distribution channels and education programs for the public and for health-care workers.
Without these components, the model collapses.
Through public-private partnerships, we can leverage unique strengths and be better equipped to expand access to health care.
This can create a symbiotic relationship, offering benefits to government, business, and the local community.
For example, Novartis’s Jiankang Kuaiche (“Health Express”) program in Xinjiang is a partnership between Novartis and the local government that aims to expand access to medicine, build capacity, and educate the public.
Health Express achieves this by training local physicians in prevention and treatment of infectious diseases and educating primary and middle-school students on health and hygiene via a traveling caravan that moves from school to school.
During a recent trip to Xinjiang, I met several physicians from rural hospitals who had received training through Health Express.
They told me that in the past, hepatitis patients had to travel for hours to be diagnosed and treated at a city hospital, while many others who were unable to make the journey suffered without treatment.
Now, with physicians trained in infectious diseases, hepatitis treatment is possible in rural areas of Xinjiang, and patient outcomes have improved significantly.
I also met with school children at Urumqi Dengcaogou Boarding School, which is situated in a rural area outside of the provincial capital.
The students were proud to be able to bring their new health-care knowledge back to their families.
They told me how they had told their parents to quit smoking after learning about the consequences of the habit on health.
These children join more than 500,000 others in Xinjiangw ho have participated in the educational component of Health Express.
By targeting schools as hubs for health-care education and shaping students into health ambassadors for their families and friends, we can reach an even greater number of people in Xinjiang’s nomadic communities.
Xinjiang means “new frontier,” and right now, we are at the edge of a new frontier in delivering sustainable health-care solutions to communities where limited resources and infrastructure constrain access to health care.
These multidimensional, scalable interventions help to bridge the gaps in developing regions.
But neither corporations nor governments can do it alone.
They need to work together to achieve the best possible outcome.
We also must abandon the idea of a one-size-fits-all model for expanding access to health care and adjust our approaches to ensure the best fit with local health priorities and customs.
With education and prevention, capacity-building, and new kinds of partnerships, we can continue to improve access to health care in Xinjiang and beyond, boosting well-being throughout the developing world.

Is Europe on a Cross of Gold?
ROME – Increasingly, one hears predictions that the euro will go the way of the gold standard in the 1930’s.
And, increasingly, the reasoning behind such forecasts seems persuasive.
But does that mean that the euro doom sayers are right?
Following the 1929 stock market crash, Europe was hit by a massive deflationary shock.
Output collapsed and unemployment soared.
Unable to agree on coordinated reflationary action, governments opted to move unilaterally.
One after another, they abandoned the gold standard, depreciating their currencies.
By loosening credit in this way, they recovered, one after another, from the Great Depression.
Today, Europe has been hit again by a massive deflationary shock.
This time, the constraint on reflationary action is the euro.
Governments lack a national currency to depreciate, and lack the power to relax credit, having delegated monetary policy to the European Central Bank.
As unemployment again rises to catastrophic heights, they will have no alternative, it is said, but to abandon the euro unilaterally.
I wrote the book on Europe and the gold standard.
Literally.
In Golden Fetters: The Gold Standard and the Great Depression, published in 1992, I argued that the deflationary engine that was the gold standard was a key cause of the 1930’s depression, and that abandoning it opened the door to recovery.
Yet I am reluctant to believe that things will turn out the same way this time.
Four differences lead me to believe that maybe – just maybe– the euro will survive.
First, mounting an appropriate monetary response is easier when you have a single central bank.
Under the gold standard, it still would have been possible for central banks to reflate their depressed economies had they moved together.
Unfortunately, getting central banks to move together is easier said than done.
Central bankers speak different languages.
They view economic prospects through different lenses.
By contrast, were the ECB to adopt decisive measures, it could reflate the entire eurozone and obviate the need for countries to act unilaterally.
But, while the ECB has the capacity, the question remains whether it is has the will.
A second difference is that, notwithstanding recent cuts in social programs, the unemployed receive more extensive public support than in the 1930’s.
This makes populist pressure to abandon the euro correspondingly less severe – the key questions, of course, being how much less severe, and whether the political center can hold.
A third difference is that the political preconditions fora cooperative response are better today.
In 1931, France refused to help stem the Central European financial crisis because it believed that Germany was rearming, in violation of the Treaty of Versailles, signed at the end of World War I. Political tensions between France and Germany may very well grow in the coming months and years, following François Hollande’s victory in the French presidential election, but they will not begin to rise to that level.
Moreover, European countries today are prepared to go to great lengths to save the euro, fearing that its collapse would jeopardize their single market.
By contrast, when countries started abandoning the gold standard in 1931, tariff barriers had already gone up.
There was no longer a single market to protect.
Finally, abandoning the gold standard was less disruptive than abandoning the euro would be.
Reintroducing national currencies today would take weeks, at a minimum, whereas Britain in 1931 could take sterling off gold while the markets were closed for the weekend.
Back then, countries still had their national currencies;they could simply stop supporting them.
Bank deposits, along with most other private and public debts, were denominated in that national currency.
Today, these assets and liabilities are all in euros.
Reintroducing the national currency in order to depreciate it, but leaving the euro value of other financial instruments untouched, would destroy balance sheets and wreak financial havoc.
The alternative – converting those other instruments into the new national currency – would tie up the offending country in litigation for years.
Each of these differences casts doubt on the notion that the euro will go the way of the gold standard.
But a fifth difference points in the other direction.
In the 1930’s, countries could not act together because they could not agree on a diagnosis of the problem.
Each attributed the Great Depression to different causes, leading them to prescribe different remedies, which they administered unilaterally.
Agreement today on the diagnosis facilitates mounting a common response.
Unfortunately, there is growing evidence that the medicine on which European countries have agreed – austerity – is killing the patient.
There is now talk of adjusting the dosage, but talk has not yet given way to action.
Will things turn out differently this time?
There is no question that the greater scope for cooperation that exists today bodes well for the euro.
But it is the precise policies on which European governments cooperate that will tell the tale.

The Long Road to Agreement with Iran
MADRID – The latest round of negotiations in Geneva between Iran and the P5+1 (the five permanent members of the United Nations Security Council plus Germany) has inspired cautious optimism.
A window of opportunity to reach agreement on Iran’s nuclear program appears to have opened.
Although the details of the meeting are not public, its relative success is clear, as the parties are to reconvene on November 7-8.
Rapprochement between Iran and the West – above all between Iran and the United States – would have positive geostrategic consequences across the Middle East.
Iran has a long way to go, of course, to bring about permanent improvement in its relations with the West; but what Iran needs to do is not the only impediment.
Other strategic actors must also be taken into account.
Without a doubt, Israel will be a major obstacle to reaching an agreement.
At the very moment when negotiations were beginning in Geneva, Prime Minister Binyamin Netanyahu said in the Knesset (Israel’s parliament) that the possibility of a pre-emptive attack on Iran’s nuclear facilities could not yet be ruled out.
Netanyahu has made Iran’s nuclear program his highest foreign-policy priority.
He is suspicious of Iran’s intentions and wants its nuclear power plants to be completely dismantled.
The fear is that so long as Iran maintains residual nuclear capacity – even for civilian use – it could develop atomic arms that would threaten Israel.
As Netanyahu made clear at the United Nations General Assembly on October 1, Israeli officials do not trust Iran’s new government to change course.
But Israel is not alone.
Sunni-ruled Saudi Arabia, the regional power competing most directly with Shia Iran for regional influence, feels left out by the incipient rapprochement with the Islamic Republic, to the point of refusing a seat on the United Nations Security Council to express its leaders’ anger.
Even in the days of the Shah, the Kingdom feared that a strong Iran might become the dominant regional power.
Heir to the historic Persian Empire, Iran has the region’s second-largest GDP and population (behind Saudi Arabia and Egypt, respectively), and Saudi Arabia worries that a possible agreement –resulting in sanctions being lifted – would allow Iran to revive its economy and extend its influence.
This is not the Saudi-US alliance’s finest hour.
The falling out over Iran follows America’s refusal to bomb Syria (another Saudi rival in the region) and its blessing of the removal in 2011 of former Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak (an important Saudi ally).
Saudi Arabia seeks the overthrow of Syrian President Bashar al-Assad, and believes that America’s agreement with Russia to destroy the Assad regime’s chemical weapons amounts to renunciation of that goal.
As a result, the Saudis are now the largest financial backer of the Syrian rebels (and one of the main supporters of the Egyptian Army following its removal in July of Mubarak’s democratically elected successor, Mohamed Morsi).
For the West, however, the most urgent goal should be to put an end to the conflict in Syria.
Too many people have already died in what has become the worst war of this century.
Iran and Russia are the Assad regime’s two main allies and the only external actors able to bring about a change of attitude in Damascus.
The Geneva II talks on Syria are tentatively set to be held on November 23, though Lakhdar Brahimi, Joint Special Representative of the UN and the Arab League for Syria, has already expressed doubts about the suitability of the meeting in the absence of credible representatives of opposition forces.
Saudi Arabia is deeply hostile to Geneva II, because formal diplomatic talks with the Assad regime imply de facto recognition that it retains legitimacy.
For the Saudis, the only acceptable solution starts with the resignation of Assad and his government, while Geneva II envisages a transitional government in which all of the parties are represented.
American policymakers have another major difficulty: the US Congress.
The last-minute agreement to raise the US debt ceiling and reopen the government has left Republican Party extremists in a weakened position, while President Barack Obama has emerged strengthened. But the episode sets a dangerous precedent.
Any conceivable agreement with Iran would involve lifting economic sanctions, which would require legislative approval – thus making a proposed deal vulnerable to congressional near-sightedness.
For the US, a concomitant problem is that Secretary of State John Kerry has made peace between Israel and Palestine a high priority.
It remains to be seen how Kerry manages to balance the negotiations so that Israeli pressure on the US with respect to Iran does not ruin efforts to achieve peace between Israelis and Palestinians.
But if Iran and the West reach an agreement, it will be very difficult for Israel to remain on the sideline.
Europe, for its part, has a good opportunity to vindicate itself by committing to a united, coherent, and effective foreign policy.
The European Union, now through High Representative for Foreign Affairs and Security Policy Catherine Ashton, has always been a key actor in the negotiations between Iran and the P5+1.
Ashton has the confidence of all the parties.
It is important for the EU to be agile and maintain close coordination with the US.
When the time comes to lift the sanctions, Europe must coordinate closely with the US in order to maximize the move’s effectiveness.
Negotiation and diplomacy are the only sure way to resolve the standoff with Iran over its nuclear program.
Another conflict in the Middle East is the worst option.
But seizing today’s unique opportunity with Iran demands long-term vision from all parties.
National interests must be placed above electoral considerations.
The window for negotiation is open; it will not remain so indefinitely.

Food for All
LONDON – With food prices having doubled in the past decade, food security is back on the international agenda.
How can the world produce more to feed the next billion people?
How can agricultural yields be raised?
What is the best way to develop aquaculture?
Unfortunately, this focus on the supply side misses half the problem.
The world already produces more than twice the number of calories that the human population requires.
An estimated one-third of global food production is wasted.
In poor countries, food is lost due to inadequate storage and gaps in the supply chain (for example, a lack of refrigeration); in rich countries, food is also wasted in the supply chain, and consumers throw a lot of food away.
Moreover, in many cases, it is poverty, not lack of food in the market, that drives hunger and nutritional deficiency.
Millions of people simply cannot afford to buy the food that they need, which could still be the case if supply were increased.
Fixing the demand side to get nutritious food to the poor –particularly to the mothers and children who are most vulnerable – is one of the most pressing food-security imperatives.
A broad range of initiatives can contribute to a solution.
For example, micro-level food security can be enhanced through programs that deliver free meals to vulnerable population groups.
Schemes that provide free meals to schoolchildren not only help to feed the young; they also create an incentive for parents to keep their children in the classroom.
Initiatives like these are especially successful when complemented with programs that provide access to clean water, energy, safe cooking stoves, and so on.
Action to reduce diarrhea – so that children retain the nutritional value of what they eat – is another part of the solution.
Of course, in very poor countries and regions, where people cannot afford to buy food on world markets, the supply side should not be neglected.
Boosting yields of locally grown staple foods (rather than cash crops) would increase self-sufficiency and strengthen resilience when international food prices are high.
At the same time, higher agricultural production must be balanced against the associated ecological and social costs.
Output in South America, Southeast Asia, and Central Africa currently is being raised mainly by clearing tropical forests, grasslands, and wetlands.
This approach contributes to climate change, interrupts hydrological cycles, and causes soil degradation, all of which undermine our planet’s ability to produce food in the long term.
If current trends continue, the majority of the world’s remaining species will be extinct by the end of the century, and it is food production, above all other factors, that has driven the decline.
More than 80% of all endangered birds and mammals are threatened by unsustainable land use resulting from agricultural expansion.
The lesson is clear: We should focus our attention on making production more efficient, reducing waste, and addressing the problem of unsustainable consumption.
Reducing food waste could save more than $250 billion worldwide – the equivalent of 65 million hectares of agricultural land use – by 2030.
Building a temperature-controlled supply chain with 30,000 tons of modern storage in China would cost more than $100 million a year for the next 20 years.
Many developing countries simply do not have the money for such up-front investment.
But, with the right focus and much more modest resources, they could dramatically improve the quality of grain silos where more than 30% of food – typically located close to the rural poor –spoils to the point of being unfit for human consumption.
There are already some positive trends that should be capitalized on globally.
In the past few years, households in the United Kingdom have cut their food waste by 21% and the food industry has trimmed its waste streams by 8%.
The public is more willing to forgo cosmetic perfection:“ugly” fruit and vegetables are the fastest-growing sector of the UK’s fresh-produce market, last year saving 300,000 tons of produce that would otherwise have been wasted for being the wrong shape or size.
Much anxiety is directed toward growing demand for meat and dairy products in China and India.
But per capita meat consumption in the United States and Europe is still more than three times higher than in either country.
In addition to eating less meat, production of it needs to be more resource-efficient.
In the past, cattle, sheep, and goats fed on grass and other energy sources unavailable to humans, while pigs and chickens fed on waste, thus contributing overall to total food availability.
Now one-third of all arable land is used to grow crops to feed livestock, not to grow staple crops for people.
The rich buy this food to feed their animals, outbidding the poor who want to buy it to feed their children.
The United Nations Environment Program estimates that using more by-products and waste to feed livestock could liberate enough food on the world market to feed an additional three billion people.
The Pig Idea campaign calls for an end to legislation in the European Union and some US states prohibiting the use of food waste to feed pigs and chickens because of the risk of animal diseases.
These risks can be managed effectively through proper treatment systems (as in Japan and South Korea).
The environmental, economic, and social benefits would be enormous.
The earth is capable of feeding everyone.
Failing to address problems affecting supply and demand amounts to grotesque mismanagement and a crime against the world’s poor, the planet’s other species, and future generations.

South Africa Breaks Out
NEW YORK – International investment agreements are once again in the news.
The United States is trying to impose a strong investment pact within the two big so-called “partnership” agreements, one bridging the Atlantic, the other the Pacific, that are now being negotiated.
But there is growing opposition to such moves.
South Africa has decided to stop the automatic renewal of investment agreements that it signed in the early post-apartheid period, and has announced that some will be terminated.
Ecuador and Venezuela have already terminated theirs.
India says that it will sign an investment agreement with the US only if the dispute-resolution mechanism is changed.
For its part, Brazil has never had one at all.
There is good reason for the resistance.
Even in the US, labor unions and environmental, health, development, and other nongovernmental organizations have objected to the agreements that the US is proposing.
The agreements would significantly inhibit the ability of developing countries’ governments to protect their environment from mining and other companies; their citizens from the tobacco companies that knowingly purvey a product that causes death and disease; and their economies from the ruinous financial products that played such a large role in the 2008 global financial crisis.
They restrict governments even from placing temporary controls on the kind of destabilizing short-term capital flows that have so often wrought havoc in financial markets and fueled crises in developing countries.
Indeed, the agreements have been used to challenge government actions ranging from debt restructuring to affirmative action.
Advocates of such agreements claim that they are needed to protect property rights.
But countries like South Africa already have strong constitutional guarantees of property rights.
There is no reason that foreign-owned property should be better protected than property owned by a country’s own citizens.
Moreover, if constitutional guarantees are not enough to convince investors of South Africa’s commitment to protecting property rights, foreigners can always avail themselves of expropriation insurance provided by the Multilateral Investment Guarantee Agency (a division of the World Bank) or numerous national organizations providing such insurance. (Americans, for example, can buy insurance from the Overseas Private Investment Corporation.)
But those supporting the investment agreements are not really concerned about protecting property rights, anyway.
The real goal is to restrict governments’ ability to regulate and tax corporations – that is, to restrict their ability to impose responsibilities, not just uphold rights.
Corporations are attempting to achieve by stealth – through secretly negotiated trade agreements – what they could not attain in an open political process.
Even the notion that this is about protecting foreign firms is a ruse: companies based in country A can set up a subsidiary in country B to sue country A’s government.
American courts, for example, have consistently ruled that corporations need not be compensated for the loss of profits from a change in regulations (a so-called regulatory taking); but, under the typical investment agreement, a foreign firm (or an American firm, operating through a foreign subsidiary) can demand compensation!
Worse, investment agreements enable companies to sue the government over perfectly sensible and just regulatory changes –when, say, a cigarette company’s profits are lowered by a regulation restricting the use of tobacco.
In South Africa, a firm could sue if it believes that its bottom line might by harmed by programs designed to address the legacy of official racism.
There is a long-standing presumption of “sovereign immunity”: states can be sued only under limited circumstances.
But investment agreements like those backed by the US demand that developing countries waive this presumption and permit the adjudication of suits according to procedures that fall far short of those expected in twenty-first-century democracies.
Such procedures have proved to be arbitrary and capricious, with no systemic way to reconcile incompatible rulings issued by different panels.
While proponents argue that investment treaties reduce uncertainty, the ambiguities and conflicting interpretations of these agreements’ provisions have increased uncertainty.
Countries that have signed such investment agreements have paid a high price.
Several have been subject to enormous suits – and enormous payouts.
There have even been demands that countries honor contracts signed by previous non-democratic and corrupt governments, even when the International Monetary Fund and other multilateral organizations have recommended that the contract be abrogated.
Even when developing-country governments win the suits (which have proliferated greatly in the last 15 years), the litigation costs are huge.
The (intended) effect is to chill governments’ legitimate efforts to protect and advance citizens’ interests by imposing regulations, taxation, and other responsibilities on corporations.
Moreover, for developing countries that were foolish enough to sign such agreements, the evidence is that the benefits, if any, have been scant.
In South Africa’s review, it found that it had not received significant investments from the countries with which it had signed agreements, but had received significant investments from those with which it had not.
It is no surprise that South Africa, after a careful review of investment treaties, has decided that, at the very least, they should be renegotiated.
Doing so is not anti-investment; it is pro-development.
And it is essential if South Africa’s government is to pursue policies that best serve the country’s economy and citizens.
Indeed, by clarifying through domestic legislation the protections offered to investors, South Africa is once again demonstrating – as it has repeatedly done since the adoption of its new Constitution in 1996 – its commitment to the rule of law.
It is the investment agreements themselves that most seriously threaten democratic decision-making.
South Africa should be congratulated. Other countries, one hopes, will follow suit.

Financial Safety Nets for Asia
SEOUL – Emerging economies are facing significant uncertainty and serious downside risks.
One major source of instability is the looming reversal of the US Federal Reserve’s expansionary monetary policy – the prospect of which is generating volatility in global financial markets and threatening to disrupt emerging-economy growth.
The Fed has signaled that its federal funds rate will remain near 0%, at least as long as unemployment exceeds 6.5% and inflation expectations remain well anchored.
But when and how the Fed will begin tightening monetary policy remains unclear.
What is certain is that, in making its decision, the Fed will not consider its policy’s spillover effects on the rest of the world, leaving affected countries’ policymakers and central bankers to deal with the fallout.
Tighter US monetary policy could intensify the global credit shortage, thereby increasing pressure on Asia’s economic and financial systems.
Overreaction and herding behavior by market participants could trigger a sudden reversal of capital inflows, with a severe dollar shortage – as occurred in 1997 and 2008 – straining Asian banks and corporations.
These risks explain why the Fed’s mere suggestion of a potential move toward reducing its purchases of long-term asset (so-called quantitative easing) caused emerging-market currencies and asset prices to plummet this summer.
They also underscore Asian economies’ need for stronger financial safety nets.
The 2008 global financial crisis revealed fundamental flaws in the international monetary system, as the failure to ensure sufficient liquidity weighed heavily on emerging Asian economies.
Since then, these countries have taken measures to safeguard the stability of their financial systems against volatile external shocks, strengthen financial supervision and regulation, and develop more effective macroeconomic frameworks, including better macro-prudential regulation and capital-control measures.
But their heavy reliance on international trade and capital flows means that they remain vulnerable to severe financial spillovers from the United States.
Moreover, since the 1997 Asian financial crisis, the region’s emerging economies have increased their holdings of foreign-exchange reserves, and now possess more than half of the world’s total.
Seven of the world’s top ten reserve-holding economies are in Asia.
But hoarding international reserves, mostly in the form of low-yielding short-term US Treasury securities, is expensive and inefficient.
Some Asian economies, especially China, are also attempting to internationalize their currencies.
Given China’s expanding global influence, the renminbi’s emergence as a new international currency is inevitable.
For smaller economies, however, internationalization will be far more difficult.
In their quest to ensure sufficient liquidity, Asian economies have also actively pursued currency-swap arrangements.
Since 2008, China has signed 23 bilateral swap agreements, including one with South Korea.
Japan expanded bilateral swap facilities with its Asian neighbors during the global financial crisis. And the ten ASEAN countries, together with China, Japan, and South Korea, have constructed a $240 billion regional reserve pool to provide short-term liquidity to members in an emergency.
Such swaps should help Asian countries to cope with currency turmoil in the wake of a Fed policy reversal. 
But they remain untested and, given their relatively small volumes, cannot reassure markets or provide adequate emergency support to crisis countries, especially in the event of large-scale systemic shocks.
The Fed, as the de facto global lender of last resort, can improve significantly the effectiveness of Asia’s financial safety nets by establishing currency-swap arrangements with emerging economies’ central banks during the policy-reversal process.
In 2008, the Fed established currency-swap lines with the central banks of ten developed economies, including the eurozone, the United Kingdom, Japan, and Switzerland, and four emerging economies (Brazil, South Korea, Mexico, and Singapore).
These arrangements, most of which ended in 2010, responded to strains in short-term credit markets and improved liquidity conditions during the crisis. The South Korean central bank’s $30 billion swap, though limited, averted a run on the won.
Reestablishing the Fed’s swap arrangements with emerging economies would minimize negative spillovers during the coming monetary-policy reversal.
Even an announcement by the Fed stating its willingness to do so would go a long way toward reassuring markets that emerging economies can avert a liquidity crisis.
The swap lines would also serve American interests.
After all, trouble in emerging economies would destabilize the entire global economy, threatening the fragile recoveries of advanced economies, including the US. And, given China’s rise, it is clearly in America’s interest to maintain a balance of economic power in Asia.
Critics might cite the moral-hazard risk generated by liquidity support.
But a well-designed framework that offers swap lines only to well-qualified emerging economies – and only temporarily – would diminish this risk substantially.
In fact, some experts, such as the economist Edwin Truman, have proposed establishing an institutionalized global swap arrangement as a more effective and robust crisis-prevention mechanism – an idea that G-20 countries should consider.
But creating such a system would take time.
In the meantime, the Fed should take the initiative by re-establishing swap lines with advanced and emerging economies alike.

The Trouble Within Islam
LONDON – There is only one view of the murder of the British soldier Lee Rigby on a south London street three weeks ago:horrific.
But there are two views of its significance.
One is that it was an act by crazy people, motivated in this case by a perverted notion of Islam, but of no broader significance.
Crazy people do crazy things, so don’t overreact.
The other view is that the ideology that inspired the murder of Rigby is profoundly dangerous.
I am of the latter view.
Of course, we shouldn’t overreact.
We didn’t after the July 7, 2005, attacks on London’s public-transport system.
But we did act. And we were right to do so.
Our security services’ actions undoubtedly prevented other serious attacks.
The “Prevent” program in local communities was sensible.
The government’s new measures seem reasonable and proportionate as well.
But we are deluding ourselves if we believe that we can protect the United Kingdom simply by what we do at home.
The ideology is out there. It is not diminishing.
Consider the Middle East.
Syria now is in a state of accelerating disintegration.
President Bashar al-Assad is brutally pulverizing entire communities that are hostile to his regime.
At least 80,000 people have died, there are almost 1.5 million refugees, and the number of internally displaced persons has risen above four million.
Many in the region believe that Assad’s aim is to cleanse the Sunni from the areas dominated by his regime and form a separate state around Lebanon.
There would then be a de facto Sunni state in the rest of Syria, cut off from the country’s wealth and access to the sea.
The Syrian opposition comprises many groups.
But the fighters associated with the Al Qaeda-affiliated group Jabhat al-Nusra are generating growing support – including arms and money from outside the country.
Assad is using chemical weapons on a limited but deadly scale.
Some of the stockpiles are in fiercely contested areas.
The West’s overwhelming desire to stay out of it is completely understandable.
But we must also understand that we are at the beginning of this tragedy.
Its capacity to destabilize the region is clear.
Jordan is behaving with exemplary courage, but there is a limit to the number of refugees that it can reasonably be expected to absorb.
Lebanon is now fragile, as Iran pushes Hezbollah into the battle.
Al Qaeda is again trying to cause carnage in Iraq, while Iran continues its meddling there.
Meanwhile, in Egypt and across North Africa, Muslim Brotherhood parties are in power, but the contradiction between their ideology and their ability to run modern economies has fueled growing instability and pressure from more extreme groups.
Then there is the Iranian regime, still intent on getting a nuclear weapon, and still exporting terror and instability.
In Sub-Saharan Africa, Nigeria is facing gruesome terror attacks.
In Mali, France fought a tough battle to prevent extremists from overrunning the country.
Then there is Pakistan – and Yemen.
Farther east, a border war between Burma and Bangladesh is simmering.
And recent events in Bangladesh itself, or in the Muslim-majority Mindanao region of the Philippines, extend the list further.
In many of the most severely affected areas, one other thing is apparent: a rapidly growing population.
The median age in the Middle East is in the mid-20s.
In Nigeria, it is 19. In Gaza, where Hamas holds power, a quarter of the population is under five.
When I return to Jerusalem soon, it will be my 100th visit to the Middle East since leaving office, working to build a Palestinian state.
I see first-hand what is happening in this region.
So I understand the desire to look at this world and explain it by reference to local grievances, economic alienation, and, of course, “crazy people.”
But can we really find no common thread, nothing that connects the dots of conflict, no sense of an ideology driving or at least exacerbating it all?
There is not a problem with Islam.
For those of us who have studied it, there is no doubt about its true and peaceful nature.
There is not a problem with Muslims in general.
Most in Britain are horrified at Rigby’s murder.
But there is a problem within Islam, and we have to put it on the table and be honest about it.
There are, of course, Christian extremists and Jewish, Buddhist, and Hindu ones.
But I am afraid that the problematic strain within Islam is not the province of a few extremists.
It has at its heart a view of religion – and of the relationship between religion and politics – that is not compatible with pluralistic, liberal, open-minded societies.
At the extreme end of the spectrum are terrorists, but the world view goes deeper and wider than it is comfortable for us to admit.
So, by and large, we don’t admit it.
This has two effects.
First, those who hold extreme views believe that we are weak, and that gives them strength.
Second, those Muslims – and the good news is that there are many – who know the problem exists, and want to do something about it, lose heart.
Throughout the Middle East and beyond, a struggle is playing out.
On one side, there are Islamists and their exclusivist and reactionary world view.
They comprise a significant minority, loud and well organized.
On the other side are the modern minded, those who hated the old oppression by corrupt dictators and despise the new oppression by religious fanatics.
They are potentially the majority; unfortunately, they are badly organized.
The seeds of future fanaticism and terror – possibly even major conflict – are being sown.
Our task is to help sow the seeds of reconciliation and peace.
But clearing the ground for peace is not always peaceful.
The long and hard conflicts in Afghanistan and Iraq have made Western powers wary of foreign intervention.
But we should never forget why these conflicts were long and hard: we allowed failed states to come into being.
Saddam Hussein was responsible for two major wars, in which hundreds of thousands died, many by chemical weapons.
He killed similar numbers of his own people.
The Taliban grew out of the Soviet occupation of Afghanistan and turned the country into a training ground for terror.
Once these regimes were removed, both countries began to struggle against the same forces promoting violence and terror in the name of religion everywhere.
Not every engagement need be military, and not every military engagement must involve troops.
But disengaging from this struggle won’t bring us peace.
Neither will security alone.
While revolutionary communism was resisted by resoluteness on security, it was ultimately defeated by a better idea:freedom.
The same can be done here.
The better idea is a modern view of religion and its place in society and politics – a model based on respect and equality among people of different faiths.
Religion may have a voice in the political system, but it must not govern it.
We have to start with children, here and abroad.
That is why I established a foundation whose specific purpose is to educate children of different faiths around the world to learn about each other and live with each other.
We are now in 20 countries, and the programs work.
But it is a drop in the ocean compared with the flood of intolerance taught to so many.
Now, more than ever, we have to be strong, and we have to be strategic.

JFK’s Women Problem
NEW YORK – The 50th anniversary of the assassination of John F. Kennedy provides an opportunity to consider the shifts inconsciousness in the United States that have occurred in the half-century since his death.
In particular, though Kennedy has entered the pantheon of American heroes, recent data show that women, especially, have been losing admiration for him as a leader.
Why?
In some ways, Kennedy’s legacy for women was as progressive as his legacy on race and poverty.
One genuinely visionary move was to ask Eleanor Roosevelt, a longtime feminist, to chair the first President’s Commission on the Status of Women.
The PCSW, which included both male and female political leaders, was a real, rather than cosmetic, effort to assess the workplace bias that women faced, what legal protections they should have, and what could be done to end gender discrimination – a concept that did not yet even have a vocabulary.
Indeed, when Kennedy convened the PCSW, women in America could be excluded from juries, lacked access to oral contraceptives and abortion, and could not even secure credit in their own names.
The same year that Kennedy was killed, Betty Friedan published The Feminine Mystique, igniting a firestorm of debate about “the problem that has no name” – women’s dissatisfaction with their limited roles.
The PCSW’s report, issued a month before Kennedy’s assassination, could have been a watershed had he lived.
But, despite his progressive stance, American women’s reassessment of the 1960’s in general has not left Kennedy’s reputation unaffected.
Once an icon of heroism, personal charm, and the quest to overcome longstanding injustices, Kennedy’s reputation has been badly damaged by tales and testimonials about the scores of women who cycled through White House bedrooms (or hotel rooms when the president traveled).
Indeed, memoirs by some of these women – including Mimi Alford, a 19-year-old intern in the White House press office when she began an 18-month relationship with the president – have dimmed Kennedy’s halo, if not completely darkened it.
So has reporting that addresses his liaisons with Marilyn Monroe and Marlene Dietrich.
Other women, such as his self-proclaimed mistress Judith Campbell, reportedly had sexual relationships with Mafia figures as well.
The sense of entitlement that sustained such male fecklessness has been steadily eroded ever since – a process that, like so much in American culture, has played out on television.
Popular series like “The Good Wife” show the pain and suffering of the political spouses who are expected to keep a stiff upper lip and a ladylike demeanor in the face of behavioral double standards.
Similarly, the series “Mad Men,” with its dashing advertising executives who consume women like lunchtime cocktails, plumbs the emptiness and destructiveness of early-1960’s male sexual prerogative.
This reassessment of male sexual privilege and irresponsibility in the 1960’s has occurred in other arenas as well– reinforcing the transformation of Kennedy’s image from charming playboy to dangerously compulsive predator.
The authorized biography of the writer Norman Mailer –notorious for saying, as feminism began to stir, that “all women should be locked in cages” – has just appeared in the US.
Mailer’s irredeemable womanizing (he also married six times) comes in for a serious critical reevaluation.
Perhaps most revealingly, while Kennedy’s aura among women has dimmed, his wife’s reputation has grown.
Jacqueline Kennedy’s dignified and substantive last decade as an accomplished book editor – an icon of the modern working, even feminist, woman – has supplanted the image of her as a doll-like hostess showing TV cameras the White House, or as the archetype of the shocked, grieving widow behind a black veil.
Her deliberately constructed-for-posterity taped conversations in March 1964 with the historian Arthur Schlesinger, published in 2011, have added to her posthumous renown.
Jacqueline Kennedy’s rising star and JFK’s increasingly tarnished one – at least when it comes to his private life and the uses to which he put his personal magnetism – reflect America’s own social evolution.
The shift in Americans’ understanding of icons like the Kennedys highlights the change – I would say for the better – in Americans’ own needs, values, and wishes concerning women and the relationship between the sexes.
JFK’s creation of the PCSW suggests that he saw what was coming, even as he remained very much a man of his time.

Reinventing Photosynthesis
PASADENA – For decades, the development of renewable energy– and the policy debates that surround it – has focused largely on electricity generation.
But more than 60% of the world’s energy is provided directly by chemical (mainly fossil) fuels, with no intermediate conversion to electricity.
No realistic effort to combat global warming by cutting carbon emissions can ignore this fundamental constraint.
Indeed, in the United States and other industrialized countries, many applications that rely on fossil fuels (such as air transport or aluminum production) cannot be reconfigured to use electrical power.
Moreover, fossil fuels are required to produce electricity as well, both to meet demand and to compensate for the intermittency of renewable energy systems such as wind or solar power.
Is there really a scalable, low-carbon alternative?
One promising approach is artificial photosynthesis, which uses non-biological materials to produce fuels directly from sunlight.
The sun is a nearly inexhaustible energy source, while energy stored in the form of chemical bonds – like those found in fossil fuels – is accessible, efficient, and convenient.
Artificial photosynthesis combines these features in aviable technology that promises energy security, environmental sustainability, and economic stability.
While natural photosynthesis provides a complex, elegant blueprint for the production of chemical fuels from sunlight, it has significant performance limitations.
Only about one-tenth of the sun’s peak energy is used;annualized net energy-conversion efficiencies are less than 1%;significant amounts of energy are expended internally to regenerate and maintain the exquisite molecular machinery of photosynthesis;and the energy is stored in chemical fuels that are incompatible with existing energy systems.
However, artificial photosynthesis, inspired by its natural variant, has demonstrated a potential for far superior performance, and provides energy in a form that can be used in our current energy infrastructure.
Moreover, a fully artificial system would not require arable land or potable water, nor would it force a choice between food and fuel production in land use.
Existing energy technologies already can be combined to generate chemical fuels efficiently, though indirectly, from sunlight, but not yet in a configuration that is simultaneously practical, scalable, and economically feasible.
Likewise, the overall efficiency of a fully integrated sunlight-to-fuel energy-conversion system can be more than ten times greater than the most energy-efficient biological systems, but the capital costs are too high for commercial deployment.
Researchers’ top priority must therefore be to develop a solar-fuel generator that combines cost-effective scalability with robustness and efficiency.
The key to creating such a system lies in using earth-abundant materials that can perform the essential functions of absorbing light and facilitating fuel-forming chemical reactions.
Just as chlorophyll serves to absorb light in natural photosynthesis, suitable materials are needed to capture and convert sunlight in artificial systems.
Although silicon’s light-absorbing properties are suitable for photo voltaic devices, the near-0.5 volts that it generates is too weak to split water in a solar-fuel generator.
An artificial system also requires catalysts to facilitate the efficient production of chemical fuels.
These catalysts must be highly active, stable, and, for global scalability, composed of earth-abundant elements, such as iron, nickel, or cobalt, not the scarce metals now used, such as ruthenium or iridium.
In addition, the system components must be integrated in a manner that ensures that they all function optimally under a common set of operating conditions.
A deployable system must also incorporate cost-effective architectures, manufacturing processes, and installation methods.
Most important, such systems must work safely.
In most implementations of artificial photosynthesis, energy-rich fuels are co-produced with oxygen, resulting in dangerous explosive mixtures.
Membranes, or other physical and chemical barriers, must be developed in order to isolate the products from one another in a reliable fashion.
Such partitions would also eliminate the need for complex peripheral processing equipment that would be necessary to separate the products prior to use in most applications.
So, what would an artificial photosynthetic system look like?
The template is not a solar panel connected to an electrolysis unit, but rather a thin roll of sandwiched plastic-like layers, much like the high-performance fabrics found in rain jackets, that can be unfurled as needed.
The top material would absorb the water and carbon dioxide from the air, and the next, light-absorbing layer would harness the sun’s energy to produce the fuel.
Separated by the membrane, the fuel would not be vented to the air but instead would wick out through the bottom of the material into a collector tank for use on demand in our existing energy-supply infrastructure.
Ideally, solar-fuel generation should offer flexibility in the types of chemical fuels that can be produced from sunlight.
In its simplest incarnation, water is split into hydrogen and oxygen gases.
The hydrogen could be converted into a liquid fuel by upgrading bio fuels, for example, or it could be reacted with carbon dioxide from flue gas or otherwise processed to produce liquid fuels for use in transportation applications.
Alternatively, catalysts, as in natural photosynthetic systems, could directly reduce carbon dioxide, in this case to methanol or methane.
The most effective systems would be able to offer either gaseous or liquid fuels.
Recent advances in nano science, materials science, chemistry, and physics have provided the tools needed to make rapid progress in this field.
The ultimate prize is a clean-energy technology that is within reach and that could provide the basis for a safe, secure, and sustainable energy future.

Innovation in Development Finance
ROME – More than four decades ago, the world’s wealthiest countries pledged that at least 0.7% of their GDP would be devoted to official development assistance (ODA).
But fewer than a half-dozen countries have actually met this goal.
In fact, ODA disbursements have not been stable, reliable, or reflective of need, and doubts about their effectiveness linger.
ODA declined significantly after the Cold War, dropping to 0.22% of developed countries’ combined GDP in 1997-2001, before rising again after the September 11, 2001, terrorist attacks in the United States and the International Conference on Financing for Development in Monterrey, Mexico, the following year.
Then, as developed-country governments imposed strict fiscal austerity in the wake of the global economic crisis, ODA fell again, to 0.31% of GDP in 2010-2011.
But, since the Monterrey conference, major additional development-finance needs have been identified, including aid-for-trade schemes and financing for climate-change mitigation and adaptation.
And, while the Leading Group on Innovative Financing for Development – which includes 63 governments, as well as international organizations and civil-society groups – has contributed to significant progress in the last decade, the definition of innovative development finance remains in dispute.
Indeed, critics contend that the international taxes – for example, on carbon emissions – that the Leading Group has identified as a potential source of finance infringe on national sovereignty.
Moreover, the sources of finance do not necessarily determine how the funds are allocated, let alone how they are ultimately used.
For example, although the so-called Tobin tax (a small levy on financial transactions) was originally intended to fund development assistance, a version of it was recently adopted in Europe in order to supplement national budget revenues.
Of course, such “off-label” uses of innovations in development finance do not discredit them.
The UN’s 2012 World Economic and Social Survey on new development finance discusses various existing and proposed innovations in financing, intermediation, and disbursement.
Aside from allocating and trading greenhouse-gas (mainly carbon or “carbon equivalent”) emissions allowances, “solidarity levies” could be imposed on airplane tickets, and taxes imposed on aviation or ship fuel.
Another proposal involves creating new international liquidity by issuing special drawing rights (international reserve assets maintained by the International Monetary Fund).
The resulting funds, as well as those from existing unused SDRs, would be allocated or re-allocated to development projects and leveraged to augment investment resources.
Yet another scheme would deploy royalties for natural-resource extraction from the global commons, such as Antarctica and other areas beyond “exclusive [national] economic zones.”
Some initiatives are already underway.
For example, the project (RED) is a corporate campaign that aims to raise money for The Global Fund to Fight AIDS, Tuberculosis, and Malaria by donating a portion of proceeds from consumer products branded with the cause.
While some are critical of the disparity between what these “altruistic” companies spend on advertising and the amount of money that they actually raise, such “cause marketing” could prove to bean effective mechanism for generating additional development finance.
Furthermore, some proposals entail no additional funds.
Development-finance flows could be restructured, so that they are channeled through mechanisms like the International Finance Facility for Immunization, which binds ODA commitments over a long period and securitizes them in order to generate funds for immediate use.
Similarly, debt-conversion schemes such as Debt2Health and debt-for-nature swaps would allow countries to redirect debt-service payments to development projects.
Some worthwhile new risk-management proposals include advance commitments for new vaccines, subsidies to drug manufacturers to make their products more affordable, and regionally pooled catastrophe insurance.
Over the last six years, roughly $6 billion has been allotted to innovative sources of financing, compared to current annual ODA of more than $120 billion – and far less than the almost$20 trillion committed by G-20 countries to economic recovery (including bailouts) since 2008.
But some recent proposals promise to raise far more resources for sustainable development.
An internationally coordinated carbon tax could raise $250 billion annually, while a small financial-transaction tax could raise another $40 billion.
Likewise, regular SDR emissions to keep pace with the growth of global liquidity could yield roughly $100 billion annually for international development cooperation.
Such emissions would reduce demand for US Treasury bonds and other liquid assets of preferred currencies.
At the same time, if the world’s most powerful countries stopped promoting full capital-account liberalization, developing countries would feel less pressure to protect themselves by accumulating foreign-exchange reserves.
By investing the funds in development projects instead, they could address both savings and foreign-exchange constraints.
Finally, innovative strategies are needed to align development finance with national development goals, transforming the multilateral system operationally so that it works more effectively with stakeholders on the ground.
One model is the Montreal Protocol on Substances that Deplete the Ozone Layer, which has succeeded spectacularly in reducing levels of chlorofluorocarbons, highlighting the continued potential of inclusive multilateralism.

The Curing Machine
VIRGINIA BEACH – Last year, the Nobel Prize in Medicine was awarded for a discovery that took 44 years to develop, and involved two different research teams.
The breakthrough promises new kinds of diagnosis and therapy, but what if such insights could be developed by computers in minutes, rather than decades?
The recent appearance of a new corona virus, which has killed nine people in the United Kingdom and the Middle East, is a reminder that novel treatments are sometimes needed in a hurry.
With different modeling abstractions, it might be possible to build an artificial-intelligence system (AI) that could design new treatments.
That system would suggest surprising, effective therapies, because it would understand disease in ways that are difficult for humans to imagine.
The notion seems like science fiction: everyone knows that AI is not particularly clever.
In order to build a “curing machine” of this kind, at least one far-reaching innovation is needed: a better way of modeling entire systems, which would deliver new conceptual tools to both biology and computer science.
In both fields, the conventional approach has been reductionist, with problems modeled at the level of their most basic components.
While this makes it possible to build “expert systems” that reason in narrow domains, or to design search engines that can find discrete facts, we are no closer to AI that reasons the way that we do – in and across multiple contexts, including time.
AI cannot integrate information about seemingly distinct processes, such as chemical, physiological, and psychological events, or anticipate novel outcomes.
We do these things over dinner.
Novelty is key.
To build a curing machine, we would need a way for computers to assemble concepts so that unexpected arrangements could emerge.
In biology, there has been a similar reductionist approach, best exemplified by the Human Genome Project, which catalogued the molecular “recipe” for every aspect of the body, in order to discover how the most basic pieces interacted.
Alas, the expected revolution in therapies is yet to occur.
Worldwide, total annual investment in biomedical research is about $110 billion.
HIV alone attracts many billions per year.
Yet, despite 25 years of intense investment in structural biology, we remain unable to move from understanding molecules to an understanding of whole systems.
A model of the dynamics between multiple processes –chemical, physiological, and psychological – would lend new insight into how diseases operate.
Consider, for example, the sense of smell.
The nasal cavity is unique, as the only place where braincells (neurons) are directly exposed to the environment.
If we model smell on local terms, we can trace how nasal neurons interact with scent particles, sending signals through a network of other neurons to the brain.
We have good abstractions in structural biology to describe this.
But these neurons are also part of an adaptive, regenerative system.
Sensory neurons die a programmed death; you literally have a new sense of smell every month.
Modeling it requires the consideration of more than just local signaling.
Neurons operate as a cooperative group: more arrive at the location than are needed for a simple replacement.
In order to facilitate the replacement, the extras become part of a dialog with surrounding cells, and others deep in the brain, then sacrifice themselves.
To explain why they voluntarily die, we would need a new system-level vocabulary.
It does not stop there.
When your neurons are replaced, they change.
If you are newly in love (or experience a trauma) and ascent is associated with it, you may develop a heightened sensitivity to that scent.
Your physio-cognitive apparatus evolves.
This process interests researchers enormously, because it is one of only two contexts in which neural regeneration occurs.
If it were understood, it could lead to cures for many crippling diseases, both neurological (like Parkinson’s and Alzheimer’s) and degenerative (including those, like cancer, associated with aging).
One way to understand how this higher-level coherence emerges is to study it in a more accessible form.
As it happens, there is a naturally occurring information structure in which the needed behaviors are easier to observe and explain.
That structure can be found in stories.
Stories are remarkable for the way that they allow us to comprehend new concepts, and continue to make sense of them, even when they involve numerous contexts and unexpected associations.
We take the resulting narrative effects for granted:surprise endings, intriguing situations, and a compulsion to read or watch until the finish.
If models of biology and AI included these dynamics, they would demonstrate how unexpected elements can emerge from an evolving coherence.
Indeed, incorporating this principle into both fields could result in new diagnostic capabilities and new forms of individualized treatment, with a different therapy designed for each person.
An infection such as the corona virus is currently countered with a vaccine tailored to block it.
But what if there was a way to “tune” bodies to reject all infections?
For example, there are a few cases of natural immunity to HIV, but we are unable to understand why.
The challenge in biomedical and computational research is to model the dynamics between diverse processes at the level of whole systems.
Once we can do this, we are much more likely to develop AI tools that are capable of unexpected breakthroughs in understanding how the body supports and resists illness.

The Problem with Poor Countries’ GDP
SEATTLE – Even in good financial times, development aid budgets are hardly overflowing.
Government leaders and donors must make hard decisions about where to focus their limited resources.
How do you decide which countries should get low-cost loans or cheaper vaccines, and which can afford to fund their own development programs?
The answer depends, in part, on how we measure growth and improvements in people’s lives. Traditionally, one of the guiding factors has been per capita GDP – the value of goods and services produced by a country in a year divided by the country’s population.
Yet GDP may be an inaccurate indicator in the poorest countries, which is a concern not only for policymakers or people like me who read lots of World Bank reports, but also for anyone who wants to use statistics to make the case for helping the world’s poorest people.
I have long believed that GDP understates growth even in rich countries, where its measurement is quite sophisticated, because it is very difficult to compare the value of baskets of goods across different time periods.
In the United States, for example, a set of encyclopedias in 1960 was expensive but held great value for families with studious kids.
(I can speak from experience, having spent many hours poring over the multi-volume World Book Encyclopedia that my parents bought for my sisters and me.)
Now, thanks to the Internet, kids have access to far more information for free.
How do you factor that into GDP?
The challenges of calculating GDP are particularly acute in Sub-Saharan Africa, owing to weak national statistics offices and historical biases that muddy crucial measurements.
Bothered by what he regarded as problems in Zambia’s national statistics, Morten Jerven, an assistant professor at Simon Fraser University, spent four years examining how African countries obtain their data and the challenges they face in turning them into GDP estimates.
His new book, Poor Numbers: How We Are Misled by African Development Statistics and What to Do about It, makes a strong case that a lot of GDP measurements that we thought were accurate are far from it.
Jerven notes that many African countries have trouble measuring the size of their relatively large subsistence economies and unrecorded economic activity.
How do you account for the production of a farmer who grows and eats his own food?
If subsistence farming is systematically underestimated, some of what looks like growth as an economy moves out of subsistence may merely reflect a shift to something that is easier to capture statistically.
There are other problems with poor countries’ GDP data.
For example, many countries in Sub-Saharan Africa do not update their reporting often enough, so their GDP numbers may miss large and fast-growing economic sectors, like cell phones.
When Ghana updated its reporting a few years ago, its GDP jumped by 60%.
But many people didn’t understand that this was just a statistical anomaly, not an actual change in Ghanaians’ standard of living.
In addition, there are several ways to calculate GDP, and they can produce wildly different results.
Jerven mentions three: the World Development Indicators, published by the World Bank (by far the most commonly used dataset); the Penn World Table, released by the University of Pennsylvania; and the Maddison Project at the University of Groningen, which is based on work by the late economist Angus Maddison.
These sources rely on the same basic data, but they modify it in different ways to account for inflation and other factors.
As a result, their rankings of different countries’ economies can vary widely.
Liberia is Sub-Saharan Africa’s second-poorest, seventh-poorest, or 22nd-poorest country in terms of GDP, depending on which authority you consult.
It is not only the relative rankings that differ.
Sometimes, one source will show a country growing by several percentage points, and another source will show it shrinking over the same time period.
Jerven cites these discrepancies to argue that we cannot be certain whether one poor country’s GDP is higher than another’s, and that we should not use GDP alone to make judgments about which economic policies lead to growth.
Does that mean that we really don’t know anything about what works (and what doesn’t) in development?
Not at all.
Researchers have long used techniques like periodic household surveys to collect data.
For example, the Demographic and Health Survey is conducted regularly to determine things like childhood and maternal death rates.
Moreover, economists are using new techniques like satellite mapping of light sources to inform their estimates of economic growth.
Although such methods are not perfect, they also are not susceptible to the same problems as GDP.
Other ways to measure overall living standards in a country are similarly imperfect; but they nonetheless provide additional ways to understand poverty.
One, called the Human Development Index, uses health and education statistics in addition to GDP.
Another, the Multidimensional Poverty Index, uses ten indicators, including nutrition, sanitation, and access to cooking fuel and water. And, by using purchasing power parity, which measures the cost of the same basket of goods and services indifferent countries, economists can adjust GDP to gain better insight into living standards.
Yet it is clear to me that we need to devote greater resources to getting basic GDP numbers right.
As Jerven argues, national statistics offices across Africa need more support so that they can obtain and report timelier and more accurate data.
Donor governments and international organizations such as the World Bank need to do more to help African authorities produce a clearer picture of their economies.
And African policymakers need to be more consistent about demanding better statistics and using them to inform decisions.
I’m a big advocate for investing in health and development around the world.
The better tools we have for measuring progress, the more we can ensure that those investments reach the people who need them the most.

Russia Stays Home
MADRID – Just three days before his return to the Kremlin as Russia’s president, Vladimir Putin met behind closed doors at his residence in Novo-Ogaryovo, outside Moscow, with US National Security Adviser Tom Donilon, who was there to transmit President Barack Obama’s renewed determination to strengthen cooperation with Russia.
But Donilon returned home empty-handed: Putin will attend neither the G-8 summit on May 18-19 at Camp David, nor the NATO summit in Chicago on May 20-21, despite Obama’s effort to accommodate Russia by moving the G-8 summit from Chicago.
As a result, what would have been the first meeting between Obama and Putin after his return to the Russian presidency has been postponed until the G-20 summit in Los Cabos, Mexico, set for June 18-19.
This delay has provoked much speculation.
Some point as a cause of Putin’s absence to recent tensions between Russia and the United States arising from Putin’s increasingly harsh response to the protests by his opponents at home.
Others suggest that Putin’s aloofness stems from Kremlin infighting.
Whatever may be driving Putin’s behavior, this month’s two summits will affect relations between the two countries considerably, given the global security issues to be discussed by the G-8 and the need to arrange for Russia’s participation in NATO’s anti-missile shield.
Two matters – besides the shaky global economy – are especially important for the G-8 summit.
First, Iran’s nuclear program is now on the diplomatic front burner.
After more than a year of deadlock, negotiations resumed in April.
Russia, as a permanent member of the United Nations Security Council, participates in these talks, and its cooperation is essential to resolving one of today’s most vexing international problems.
Much the same can be said of Russia’s role in resolving the crisis in Syria, owing to the strategic relationship that the two countries have maintained since the Cold War.
Indeed, with the growing possibility that former UN Secretary-General Kofi Annan’s peace plan for Syria might fail, and that civil war might erupt, Russia could be the international community’s only effective interlocutor left.
In addition, it is essential to align the positions of Russia and the West on the anti-missile shield system now being developed by NATO, which will be a subject for discussion in Chicago.
The principal aim of the system is to protect Europe and the US from possible attacks by short- and medium-range ballistic missiles from Iran and North Korea.
But Russian leaders are skeptical about the true objectives of a shield, believing that it would undermine Russia’s security by curtailing the retaliatory (and thus deterrent) capacity of its nuclear missiles.
In 2009, the “approach by stages of adaptation” launched by Obama seemed to ease bilateral tensions and prepared the way for the 2010 New START arms-reduction treaty, in which Russia and the Us took a strategic leap to cut the number of nuclear-missile launchers by half.
Following on this progress, at the end of 2010, the Russians agreed to study the possibility of cooperating with NATO on anti-missile defense.
But the US was unable to offer legal – not just political –guarantees that an anti-missile system based in Europe would not obstruct Russia’s strategic potential.
As a result, Russia is now so mistrustful that its military chief of staff, General Nikolai Makarov, recently declared that his country would not rule out pre-emptive attacks to destroy any part of the anti-missile shield that it views as a threat to its own security.
One of the main arguments for this posture was Russia’s uncertainty about whether later steps in the “approach by stages of adaptation” might be a threat to its strategic ballistic missiles.
Moreover, Russia opposes the deployment of military facilities in countries – like Romania – that joined NATO after 1999, a point made recently by former US ambassador to Ukraine Steven Pifer of the Brookings Institution.
In view of the seriousness of the questions under consideration at the two summits, Putin’s presence would have been helpful.
In addition to the inherent value of improving the personal chemistry between leaders, reducing tensions in the relationship between Russia and the West has become indispensable, given that negotiations over the missile shield, Iran, Syria, and other issues are bound to be long – and that the solutions are linked.
Indeed, acceptable solutions today would open the way for an unprecedented nuclear-arms agreement in 2013.
This is a matter of major importance, for which a good understanding between Russia and the US is essential.
We must do everything within our power to realize Donilon’s proposal to Putin to, in essence, “reset the reset” and bridge the gap between the two countries concerning the future disposition of their nuclear arsenals.
For Obama, success would vindicate the Nobel Peace Prize that he was awarded in 2009.
Russia, we can be sure, would benefit as well.

The Four “Cs” of Innovation
PARIS – Innovation is now widely acknowledged to be a prerequisite for sustainable economic growth.
Whether the changes are profoundly disruptive, or merely provide incremental improvements in products, services, or business models, the results boost an economy’s long-run productivity.
And innovation is necessary not only for developed economies, but also for emerging markets, which are receiving diminishing returns from simply transposing advanced economies’ best practices. But, while every country needs to innovate, the tried and tested approaches do not work for all markets.
Clayton Christensen of Harvard Business School has identified three broad forms of innovation that make firms – and ultimately economies – stronger.
Firms can make incremental changes to existing products, thereby becoming more competitive in an existing market segment;they can introduce products, like Sony’s iconic Walkman or Apple’s iPhone, that create new market segments; or they can develop a product – such as electricity, the car, or an Internet search engine – that is so disruptive that it renders an entire sector or way of doing business almost obsolete.
The challenge for governments is to devise ways to encourage firms or individuals to engage in more such innovation to bolster economic growth.
Much of the research in this area, influenced by the work of Harvard’s Michael Porter, has been dominated by “cluster studies,” which typically focus on improving productivity in emerging economies and regions within advanced economies.
As a result, over the past two decades, policymakers’ attention has shifted from trying to understand Asia’s so-called tiger economies toward recreating the successful clusters of Silicon Valley, Boston’s Route 128, Taiwan’s Hsinchu Park, South Korea’s Daedeok Science Town, and Israel’s Silicon Wadi.
Such clusters, however, often have attributes that cannot be replicated easily elsewhere.
Silicon Valley’s achievements are, arguably, a function of a unique cultural legacy rather than government policy (though government has indirectly underpinned some of its most successful startups).
Likewise, the early strategic government intervention –including planning, subsidies, and state ownership – that has underpinned innovation-led growth models in Israel, South Korea, and Taiwan is simply not available in many countries.
Fortunately, there is a third approach, evident in the numerous innovation successes in Europe, Asia, the Middle East, and elsewhere that neither had state backing nor occurred within a uniquely creative business culture.
Consider, for example, the Internet-based telecoms firm Skype, created in Estonia; Rovio’s “Angry Birds” video game, made in Finland; the TomTom GPS navigation system, developed in the Netherlands; Navigon, another navigation system, and SoundCloud, a music download service, both made in Germany; Maktoob, an Arabic Internet service provider, and Rubicon, a burgeoning animation educational company, both established in Jordan; and Infosys and Wipro, two of many successful technology ventures in India.
In studying these and other cases, the Innovation and Policy Initiative at INSEAD has identified four factors – the “Four Cs” – that support technological innovation and entrepreneurship:cost, convenience, caliber, and creative destruction.
Success lies in the ability of firms to combine these factors either in a single country or across several markets.
For example, Niklas Zennström and Janus Friis left their native Sweden and Denmark, respectively, for low-cost, talent-rich Estonia to create Skype.
Thus, the two Scandinavians’ creative-destructive thinking was combined with Estonia’s low-cost, enterprise-friendly environment.
The Swedish founders of SoundCloud, Alexander Ljung and Eric Wahlforss, decided that they were better off in relatively cheap Berlin, at the heart of Europe’s underground music scene.
Similarly, Samih Toukan and Hussam Khoury, who created Maktoob (now owned by Yahoo), were able to combine the comparative advantage of Jordan’s creative talent and low costs with the quality and convenience of Dubai’s infrastructure and business networks.
Sometimes, the overwhelming benefits of one or more factors are decisive.
The caliber of Finland’s infrastructure, workforce, and domestic networks overrode the concerns of Rovio’s Finnish founders about their country’s high costs and inconvenient location, so they decided to start their new business at home.
But, increasingly, innovative startups operating in a mobile, globalized world will find that they can circumvent constraints in one location by shifting some or all of their assets or operations to another.
The challenge for governments is to improve those less mobile factors of innovation – cost, caliber, and convenience – in order to attract, retain, and encourage free-flowing capital and the most creative citizens.

Learning from Rwanda
GENEVA – How is it that Rwanda, among the world’s poorest countries – and still recovering from a brutal civil war – is able to protect its teenage girls against cancer more effectively than the G-8 countries?
After just one year, Rwanda reported vaccinating more than 93% of its adolescent girls against the human papillomavirus (HPV)– by far the largest cause of cervical cancer.
Vaccine coverage in the world’s richest countries varies, but in some places it is less than 30%.
In fact, poor coverage in the world’s richest countries should come as no great surprise, especially when one considers the demographics of those missing out.
Where available, evidence suggests that they are mainly girls at the lower end of the socioeconomic spectrum – often members of ethnic minorities with no health-care coverage.
This implies that those who are at greatest risk are not being protected.
It is a familiar story, one that is consistent with the global pattern of this terrible disease, which claims a life every two minutes: those most in need of protection have the least access to it.
Of the 275,000 women and girls who die of cervical cancer every year, 88% live in developing countries, where mortality rates can be more than 20 times higher than in France, Italy, and the United States.
That is not just because vaccines are not readily available; it is also because women in these countries have limited access to screening and treatment.
Without prevention, they have no options if they get sick.
Alarmingly, in some of the wealthy countries, where both screening and treatment should be readily available, vaccine coverage now appears to be declining, raising a real danger that socioeconomically disadvantaged girls there will face a similar fate.
If it turns out that girls at risk of not receiving all three doses of the HPV vaccine are also those with an elevated risk of being infected and missing cervical screenings as adults, they may be slipping through not one but two nets.
It is still not clear why this is happening.
What we do know is that HPV is a highly infectious sexually transmitted virus, which is responsible for almost all forms of cervical cancer.
HPV vaccines can prevent 70% of these cases by targeting the two most common types of the virus, but only if girls have not yet been exposed to the virus, which means vaccinating them before they become sexually active.
Yet efforts to communicate this to the public have been met with skepticism from some critics, who argue that the vaccine gives young girls tacit consent to engage in sexual activity, ultimately leading to an increase in promiscuity.
However, quite apart from the evidence to the contrary, intuitively this makes no sense.
To suggest that giving girls aged 9-13 three injections over six months gives them a green light to engage in sex and sets them on a path to promiscuity is utter nonsense.
It is like saying that people are more likely to drive dangerously if they wear a seat belt; in fact, the opposite is more often the case.
Whether such attitudes and misinformation account for poor vaccine coverage in places like France and the US is still not known.
It may simply be that some parents or girls mistakenly believe that one shot of the HPV vaccine is enough to provide protection, or that some socially disadvantaged girls lack sufficient access to in-school vaccination services.
Or perhaps the cost of the vaccine is a barrier in some of these countries.
Whatever the reason, unless coverage for all three doses increases, cervical cancer and pre-cancer rates will increase.
In countries like Rwanda, people know this only too well, which is why they have been so eager to tighten the net on HPV.
They have seen the horrors of cervical cancer, with women in the prime of their lives presenting with late-stage disease and suffering slow and painful deaths.
Without changes in prevention and control, deaths from cervical cancer worldwide are projected to rise almost two-fold by 2030, to more than 430,000 per year.
And now, with help from my organization, the GAVI Alliance, a public-private partnership created to improve access to new vaccines for the world’s poorest children, other low-income countries are following Rwanda’s lead.
As of this year, Ghana, Kenya, Laos, Madagascar, Malawi, Mozambique, Niger, Sierra Leone, Tanzania, and Zimbabwe have all taken steps to introduce HPV vaccines, with more countries expected to follow.
G-8 countries’ generous contributions to organizations like mine show that they understand the importance of childhood immunization.
But, while HPV infection rates may be falling in some of these countries, are they falling fast enough?
In the US, for example, the G-8 country for which we currently have the most data, infection rates have halved in the six years since the vaccine was first introduced.
Yet failure to reach the 80% coverage mark means that 50,000 American girls alive today will develop cervical cancer, as will another 4,400 girls with each year of delay.
So it is worth remembering that even in wealthy countries, there is an urgent need to overcome challenges in protecting the hardest-to-reach girls, who often are at high risk of HPV infection.
Overcoming these challenges is essential to reducing cervical cancer and pre-cancer rates in the coming years.
Rwanda’s success should be the norm, not the exception.

Standards for Non-Standard Monetary Policy
PARIS – The widespread introduction of unconventional monetary-policy measures by major central banks has been a defining characteristic of the global financial crisis.
We have seen enhanced credit support, credit easing, quantitative easing, interventions in currency and securities markets, and the provision of liquidity in foreign currency – to name but a few of the measures taken.
Some view these measures as a continuation of standard policy by other means.
Once nominal interest rates cannot be lowered further, central banks use other tools to determine the monetary-policy stance.
They have reached the end of the road, so they shift into four-wheel drive: they expand their balance sheets and inject liquidity to influence the structure of yields and returns and thereby stimulate aggregate demand.
But when central banks return to the road – that is, exit from the non-standard measures – they must retrace their path, first unwinding unconventional policy, and only then raising interest rates.
Let me suggest a different view.
Say that key interest rates are to be set at levels considered appropriate to maintain price stability, drawing on regular, comprehensive assessment of economic and monetary conditions.
Following standard practice, interest rates can be more or less significantly positive, very close to zero, or at zero.
But, whatever the level of nominal interest rates, the monetary-policy stance established in this way has often been poorly transmitted to the economy, particularly in times of acute crisis.
During the financial crisis, market functioning was impaired, at times very profoundly.
Non-standard measures helped to clear standard measures’ transmission path.
By this logic, if the transmission of standard measures is impeded in a significant way, non-standard measures can offer support.
And, as for the exit, standard and non-standard measures can be determined largely independently.
Policymakers are not obliged to unwind non-standard measures before considering interest-rate increases, or to push interest rates to the zero lower bound before considering unconventional measures.
Standard measures depend on the medium- and long-term outlook for price stability, whereas non-standard measures depend on the degree of dysfunction of the monetary-policy transmission mechanism.
This second view has characterized the European Central Bank’s approach to monetary policy since the start of the financial crisis.
The ECB’s first non-standard measure – unlimited supply of liquidity at fixed rates against appropriate collateral – was introduced in August 2007, when the minimum bid rate of its main refinancing operation was 4.25% – nowhere near the zero bound.
Non-standard measures were required to ensure that the monetary-policy stance would be more effectively transmitted to the broader economy, notwithstanding the dislocations observed in some financial markets.
Obvious, unconventional measures, if not carefully monitored, might have the unintended consequence of creating an abnormally benign financial environment for markets, commercial banks, and sovereigns.
This, in turn, could delay needed improvements in financial regulation, balance-sheet repair by banks, structural economic reform, and fiscal adjustment.
As a result, non-standard measures must satisfy five conditions.
First, they must be as commensurate as possible with the degree of market dislocation and disruption of market that they aim to counter, which is always a matter of judgment.
In most cases, the measures must be tailored to avoid the total disruption of markets.
The ECB has never hesitated to increase or decrease the scope of its non-standard tools – in particular, the duration of the non-standard supply of liquidity – depending on the abnormality in the functioning of the financial system.
Second, the measures must be accompanied by forceful messages to commercial banks to address their medium-term recapitalization and balance-sheet-repair issues.
To the extent that banks are, by far, the ECB’s main instrument for “non-standard” refinancing, this message is particularly important in Europe.
Third, the measures must be accompanied by equally forceful messages, when and where needed, to the governments concerned.
When non-standard measures are required because of loss of confidence in sovereign debt, such messages must seek to avoid the measures’ failure by highlighting the risk of major additional difficulties in the future.
Fourth, in the case of Europe, the European Union institutions, as well as the member states, must be urged to strengthen economic governance, including through close monitoring of individual countries’ economic and budgetary policies.
The ECB’s governing council has been highly vocal on this issue since the start of the crisis.
Finally, to the extent that the combined non-standard measures of the advanced economies’ central banks are creating a very substantial structural change in the global economy’s monetary and financial environment, it seems necessary to call for the appropriate reinforcement of global governance.
As long as these central banks consider non-standard measures necessary, they are entitled to be vocal advocates of the necessary reforms of global finance; the necessary adjustment of global imbalances within the framework of the G-20; and the decisive contribution of multilateral lenders.
The ECB’s decision in December 2011 to launch its long-term refinancing operation, which supplies low-cost three-year financing to commercial banks, meets these five conditions.
The LTRO’s duration, in particular, is appropriate, given the growing threat of major dysfunction in the European banking sector in October, November, and at the beginning of December last year.
Moreover, ECB President Mario Draghi, my successor, made loud and clear the importance of reinforcing banks’ balance sheets, adjusting individual countries’ strategies, and improving governance in the eurozone and the EU as a whole.
In all of these domains, as well as at the global level, where reform is equally urgent, there is no longer any room for complacency.

The Peace-Prosperity Cycle
NEW YORK – At the 68th session of the United Nations General Assembly, which began on September 17, world leaders are laying the foundations of a development agenda to succeed the Millennium Development Goals (MDGs), which expire in 2015.
The upcoming Sustainable Development Goals will be based on the understanding that economic development is key to improving human well-being and securing the most vulnerable people’s rights.
But, in order to make genuine progress, policymakers must address the factors that constrain development, particularly violence and conflict.
According to the Global Peace Index, containing violence –including internal and external conflicts, as well as violent crimes and homicides – cost the world almost $9.5 trillion, or 11% of global GDP, last year.
That is 75 times the volume of official overseas development assistance in 2012, which amounted to $125.6 billion, and nearly double the value of the world’s annual agricultural production. (For further perspective, the post-2008 global financial crisis caused global GDP to fall by 0.6%.)
This means that if the world were to reduce its violence-related expenditure by approximately 50%, it could repay the debt of the developing world ($4.1 trillion), provide enough money for the European Stability Mechanism ($900 billion), and fund the additional amount required to achieve the MDGs ($60 billion).
Reducing violence-related expenditure by even 10% would save $473 billion, while contributing to output growth worth an additional $473 billion – money that could be channeled toward infrastructure, health care, or educational services.
And these are conservative estimates; they do not reflect costs related to property crime, burglary, vehicle theft, domestic violence, surveillance equipment, lost wages, and lower productivity, because accurate data are not yet available.
Just as long-term economic development requires political stability, peace can be achieved only in an environment of economic progress and prosperity.
External shocks, such as sudden food-price fluctuations, may raise tension within communities – especially those that lack adequate social-safety nets – and even lead to conflict.
This occurred in Colombia in the 1990’s, when an unexpected drop in coffee prices lowered wages and intensified conflict in coffee-dependent regions.
Likewise, pervasive or rising unemployment undermines peace by encouraging the proliferation of criminal networks, gangs, and rebel groups.
Indeed, in the World Bank’s 2011 World Development Report, young people in conflict-affected countries cited unemployment and idleness as the most compelling reasons for joining such organizations.
Given this, governments must intensify their efforts to foster job creation and improve employment opportunities –including finding ways to finance relevant policies and programs.
They could begin by enhancing the efficiency of violence-related expenditure.
In the United States, for example, researchers with the Institute for Economics and Peace found that more than one out of every seven dollars spent – a total of almost $2.2 trillion in 2010 and a staggering 37% of that year’s federal budget – is devoted to preventing and dealing with the consequences of violence.
In other words, US violence-related expenditure is almost equal to the output of the entire British economy, approximately$2.4 trillion.
Just as the ongoing health-care debate focuses on reducing costs while improving outcomes, a public debate centered on the costs and effectiveness of violence prevention and recovery programs should be launched.
With thorough analysis, governments could identify surplus funds that might be redirected to development pursuits, thereby bolstering productivity, enhancing human well-being, and laying the foundations for a peaceful society.
For example, a mere 5% annual reduction in federal spending on violence containment in the US over the next three years could provide the capital to update the entire country’s school infrastructure.
The virtuous cycle by which prosperity engenders peace, which in turn fuels greater prosperity, is also apparent in education investment.
Education enhances workers’ skills, knowledge, and behaviors, thereby boosting their productivity.
This promotes stability and social cohesion, while making communities more resilient to economic, geopolitical, or natural disasters.
Peaceful and prosperous Scandinavian countries, which boast high education levels, are a case in point.
But the cycle runs in reverse, too.
In Greece, for example, the recent economic downturn, exacerbated by strict austerity measures, has fueled violent demonstrations.
And prolonged conflict has had a devastating impact on Iraq’s economy.
Three decades ago, after Iraq initiated hostilities with Iran, its per capita annual GDP plummeted, from $5,374 in 1980 to$1,253 in 1991.
It is easy to perpetuate the vicious cycle between economic hardship and conflict; indeed, such an outcome requires only that policymakers do nothing.
Reversing the cycle, however, is a difficult undertaking –one that requires carefully crafted policies, effective programs, and substantial investment.
In formulating the post-2015 development agenda, world leaders must recognize the tremendous impetus that less violent, more harmonious societies would provide for economic development.
By stimulating a virtuous cycle of peace and prosperity, policymakers can contribute to the well-being of people worldwide.
Now that is a goal worth pursuing.

Sub-Saharan Africa’s Subprime Borrowers
NEW YORK – In recent years, a growing number of African governments have issued Eurobonds, diversifying away from traditional sources of finance such as concessional debt and foreign direct investment.
Taking the lead in October 2007, when it issued a $750 million Eurobond with an 8.5% coupon rate, Ghana earned the distinction of being the first Sub-Saharan country – other than South Africa – to issue bonds in 30 years.
This debut Sub-Saharan issue, which was four times oversubscribed, sparked a sovereign borrowing spree in the region.
Nine other countries – Gabon, the Democratic Republic of the Congo, Côte d’Ivoire, Senegal, Angola, Nigeria, Namibia, Zambia, and Tanzania – followed suit.
By February 2013, these ten African economies had collectively raised $8.1 billion from their maiden sovereign-bond issues, with an average maturity of 11.2 years and an average coupon rate of 6.2%.
These countries’ existing foreign debt, by contrast, carried an average interest rate of 1.6% with an average maturity of 28.7 years.
It is no secret that sovereign bonds carry significantly higher borrowing costs than concessional debt does.
So why are an increasing number of developing countries resorting to sovereign-bond issues?
And why have lenders suddenly found these countries desirable?
With quantitative easing having driven interest rates to record lows, one explanation is that this is just another, more obscure manifestation of investors’ search for yield.
Moreover, recent analyses, carried out in conjunction with the establishment of the new BRICS bank, have demonstrated the woeful inadequacy of official assistance and concessional lending for meeting Africa’s infrastructure needs, let alone for achieving the levels of sustained growth needed to reduce poverty significantly.
Moreover, the conditionality and close monitoring typically associated with the multilateral institutions make them less attractive sources of financing.
What politician wouldn’t prefer money that gives him more freedom to do what he likes?
It will be years before any problems become manifest – and, then, some future politician will have to resolve them.
To the extent that this new lending is based on Africa’s strengthening economic fundamentals, the recent spate of sovereign-bond issues is a welcome sign.
But here, as elsewhere, the record of private-sector credit assessments should leave one wary.
So, are shortsighted financial markets, working with shortsighted governments, laying the groundwork for the world’s next debt crisis?
The risks will undoubtedly grow if sub-national authorities and private-sector entities gain similar access to the international capital markets, which could result in excessive borrowing.
Nigerian commercial banks have already issued international bonds; in Zambia, the power utility, railway operator, and road builder are planning to issue as much as $4.5 billion in international bonds.
Evidence of either irrational exuberance or market expectations of a bailout is already mounting.
How else can one explain Zambia’s ability to lock in a rate that was lower than the yield on a Spanish bond issue, even though Spain’s credit rating is four grades higher?
Indeed, except for Namibia, all of these Sub-Saharan sovereign-bond issuers have “speculative” credit ratings, putting their issues in the “junk bond” category and signaling significant default risk.
Signs of default stress are already showing.
In March 2009 – less than two years after the issue –Congolese bonds were trading for 20 cents on the dollar, pushing the yield to a record high.
In January 2011, Côte d’Ivoire became the first country to default on its sovereign debt since Jamaica in January 2010.
In June 2012, Gabon delayed the coupon payment on its $1 billion bond, pending the outcome of a legal dispute, and was on the verge of a default.
Should oil and copper prices collapse, Angola, Gabon, Congo, and Zambia may encounter difficulties in servicing their sovereign bonds.
To ensure that their sovereign-bond issues do not turn into a financial disaster, these countries should put in place a sound, forward-looking, and comprehensive debt-management structure.
They need not only to invest the proceeds in the right type of high-return projects, but also to ensure that they do not have to borrow further to service their debt.
These countries can perhaps learn from the bitter experience of Detroit, which issued $1.4 billion worth of municipal bonds in 2005 to ward off an impending financial crisis.
Since then, the city has continued to borrow, mostly to service its outstanding bonds.
In the process, four Wall Street banks that enabled Detroit to issue a total of $3.7 billion in bonds since 2005 have reaped$474 million in underwriting fees, insurance premiums, and swaps.
Understanding the risks of excessive private-sector borrowing, the inadequacy of private lenders’ credit assessments, and the conflicts of interest that are endemic in banks, Sub-Saharan countries should impose constraints on such borrowing, especially when there are significant exchange-rate and maturity mismatches.
Countries contemplating joining the bandwagon of sovereign-bond issuers would do well to learn the lessons of the all-too-frequent debt crises of the past three decades.
Matters may become even worse in the future, because so-called “vulture” funds have learned how to take full advantage of countries in distress.
Recent court rulings in the United States have given the vultures the upper hand, and may make debt restructuring even more difficult, while enthusiasm for bailouts is clearly waning.
The international community may rightly believe that both borrowers and lenders have been forewarned.
There are no easy, risk-free paths to development and prosperity.
But borrowing money from international financial markets is a strategy with enormous downside risks, and only limited upside potential – except for the banks, which take their fees upfront.
Sub-Saharan Africa’s economies, one hopes, will not have to repeat the costly lessons that other developing countries have learned over the past three decades.

Innovation Crisis or Financial Crisis?
CAMBRIDGE – As one year of sluggish growth spills into the next, there is growing debate about what to expect over the coming decades.
Was the global financial crisis a harsh but transitory setback to advanced-country growth, or did it expose a deeper long-term malaise?
Recently, a few writers, including internet entrepreneur Peter Thiel and political activist and former world chess champion Garry Kasparov, have espoused a fairly radical interpretation of the slowdown.
In a forthcoming book, they argue that the collapse of advanced-country growth is not merely a result of the financial crisis.; at its root, they argue, these countries’ weakness reflects secular stagnation in technology and innovation.
As such, they are unlikely to see any sustained pickup in productivity growth without radical changes in innovation policy.
Economist Robert Gordon takes this idea even further.
He argues that the period of rapid technological progress that followed the Industrial Revolution may prove to be a 250-year exception to the rule of stagnation in human history.
Indeed, he suggests that today’s technological innovations pale in significance compared to earlier advances like electricity, running water, the internal combustion engine, and other breakthroughs that are now more than a century old.
I recently debated the technological stagnation thesis with Thiel and Kasparov at Oxford University, joined by encryption pioneer Mark Shuttleworth.
Kasparov pointedly asked what products such as the iPhone 5 really add to our capabilities, and argued that most of the science underlying modern computing was settled by the seventies.
Thiel maintained that efforts to combat the recession through loose monetary policy and hyper-aggressive fiscal stimulus treat the wrong disease, and therefore are potentially very harmful.
These are very interesting ideas, but the evidence still seems overwhelming that the drag on the global economy mainly reflects the aftermath of a deep systemic financial crisis, not along-term secular innovation crisis.
There are certainly those who believe that the wellsprings of science are running dry, and that, when one looks closely, the latest gadgets and ideas driving global commerce are essentially derivative.
But the vast majority of my scientist colleagues at top universities seem awfully excited about their projects in nanotechnology, neuroscience, and energy, among other cutting-edge fields.
They think they are changing the world at a pace as rapid as we have ever seen.
Frankly, when I think of stagnating innovation as an economist, I worry about how overweening monopolies stifle ideas, and how recent changes extending the validity of patents have exacerbated this problem.
No, the main cause of the recent recession is surely a global credit boom and its subsequent meltdown.
The profound resemblance of the current malaise to the aftermath of past deep systemic financial crises around the world is not merely qualitative.
The footprints of crisis are evident in indicators ranging from unemployment to housing prices to debt accumulation.
It is no accident that the current era looks so much like what followed dozens of deep financial crises in the past.
Granted, the credit boom itself may be rooted in excessive optimism surrounding the economic-growth potential implied by globalization and new technologies.
As Carmen Reinhart and I emphasize in our book This Time is Different, such fugues of optimism often accompany credit run-ups, and this is hardly the first time that globalization and technological innovation have played a central role.
Attributing the ongoing slowdown to the financial crisis does not imply the absence of long-term secular effects, some of which are rooted in the crisis itself.
Credit contractions almost invariably hit small businesses and start-ups the hardest.
Since many of the best ideas and innovations come from small companies rather than large, established firms, the ongoing credit contraction will inevitably have long-term growth costs.
At the same time, unemployed and underemployed workers’ skill sets are deteriorating.
Many recent college graduates are losing as well, because they are less easily able to find jobs that best enhance their skills and thereby add to their long-term productivity and earnings.
With cash-strapped governments deferring urgently needed public infrastructure projects, medium-term growth also will suffer.
And, regardless of technological trends, other secular trends, such as aging populations in most advanced countries, are taking a toll on growth prospects as well.
Even absent the crisis, countries would have had to make politically painful adjustments to pension and health-care programs.
Taken together, these factors make it easy to imagine trend GDP growth being one percentage point below normal for another decade, possibly even longer.
If the Kasparov-Thiel-Gordon hypothesis is right, the outlook is even darker – and the need for reform is far more urgent.
After all, most plans for emerging from the financial crisis. assume that technological progress will provide a strong foundation of productivity growth that will eventually underpin sustained recovery.
The options are far more painful if the pie has ceased growing quickly.
So, is the main cause of the recent slowdown an innovation crisis or a financial crisis?
Perhaps some of both, but surely the economic trauma of the last few years reflects, first and foremost, a financial meltdown, even if the way forward must simultaneously treat other obstacles to long-term growth.

King Ludd is Still Dead
CAMBRIDGE – Since the dawn of the industrial age, a recurrent fear has been that technological change will spawn mass unemployment.
Neoclassical economists predicted that this would not happen, because people would find other jobs, albeit possibly after a long period of painful adjustment.
By and large, that prediction has proven to be correct.
Two hundred years of breathtaking innovation since the dawn of the industrial age have produced rising living standards for ordinary people in much of the world, with no sharply rising trend for unemployment.
Yes, there have been many problems, notably bouts of staggering inequality and increasingly horrific wars.
On balance, however, throughout much of the world, people live longer, work much fewer hours, and lead generally healthier lives.
But there is no denying that technological change nowadays has accelerated, potentially leading to deeper and more profound dislocations.
In a much-cited 1983 article, the great economist Wassily Leontief worried that the pace of modern technological change is so rapid that many workers, unable to adjust, will simply become obsolete, like horses after the rise of the automobile.
Are millions of workers headed for the glue factory?
As Asian wages rise, factory managers are already looking for opportunities to replace employees with robots, even in China.
As the advent of cheap smart phones fuels a boom in Internet access, online purchases will eliminate a vast number of retail jobs.
Back-of-the-envelope calculations suggest that, worldwide, technological change could easily lead to the loss of 5-10 million jobs each year.
Fortunately, until now, market economies have proved stunningly flexible in absorbing the impact of these changes.
A peculiar but perhaps instructive example comes from the world of professional chess.
Back in the 1970’s and 1980’s, many feared that players would become obsolete if and when computers could play chess better than humans.
Finally, in 1997, the IBM computer Deep Blue defeated world chess champion Gary Kasparov in a short match.
Soon, potential chess sponsors began to balk at paying millions of dollars to host championship matches between humans.
Isn’t the computer world champion, they asked?
Today, the top few players still earn a very good living, but less than at the peak.
Meanwhile, in real (inflation-adjusted) terms, second-tier players earn much less money from tournaments and exhibitions than they did in the 1970’s.
Nevertheless, a curious thing has happened: far more people make a living as professional chess players today than ever before.
Thanks partly to the availability of computer programs and online matches, there has been a mini-boom in chess interest among young people in many countries.
Many parents see chess as an attractive alternative to mindless video games.
A few countries, such as Armenia and Moldova, have actually legislated the teaching of chess in schools.
As a result, thousands of players nowadays earn surprisingly good incomes teaching chess to children, whereas in the days before Deep Blue, only a few hundred players could truly make a living as professionals.
In many US cities, for example, good chess teachers earn upwards of $100-$150 per hour.
Yesterday’s unemployed chess bum can bring in a six-figure income if he or she is willing to take on enough work.
In fact, this is one example where technology might actually have contributed to equalizing incomes. Second-tier chess players who are good teachers often earn as much as top tournament players – or more.
Of course, the factors governing the market for chess incomes are complex, and I have vastly over-simplified the situation.
But the basic point is that the market has a way of transforming jobs and opportunities in ways that no one can predict.
Technological change is not all upside, and transitions can be painful.
An unemployed autoworker in Detroit may be fully capable of retraining to become a hospital technician. Yet, after years of taking pride in his work, he could be very reluctant to make the switch.
I know a chess grandmaster who, 20 years ago, prided himself on his success at winning money in tournaments.
He vowed that he would never end up teaching children “how horsey moves” (the reference is to the knight, also called the horse).
But now he does exactly that, earning more from teaching “how horsey moves” than he ever did as a competitive chess player. 
Still, it beats being sent to the knacker.
Of course, this time technological change could be different, and one should be careful in extrapolating the experience of the last two centuries to the next two.
For one thing, mankind will be confronted with more complex economic and moral questions as technology accelerates.
Still, even as technological change accelerates, nothing suggests a massive upward shift in unemployment over the next few decades.
Of course, some increase in unemployment as a result of more rapid technological change is certainly likely, especially in places like Europe, where a plethora of rigidities inhibit smooth adjustment.
For now, however, the high unemployment of the past several years should be mainly attributed to the financial crisis, and should ultimately retreat toward historical benchmark levels.
Humans are not horsies.

Did Capitalism Fail?
NEW YORK – Until six days before Lehman Brothers collapsed five years ago, the ratings agency Standard &amp; Poor’s maintained the firm’s investment-grade rating of “A.”
Moody’s waited even longer, downgrading Lehman one business day before it collapsed.
How could reputable ratings agencies – and investment banks– misjudge things so badly?
Regulators, bankers, and ratings agencies bear much of the blame for the crisis.
But the near-meltdown was not so much a failure of capitalism as it was a failure of contemporary economic models’ understanding of the role and functioning of financial markets –and, more broadly, instability – in capitalist economies.
These models provided the supposedly scientific underpinning for policy decisions and financial innovations that made the worst crisis since the Great Depression much more likely, if not inevitable.
After Lehman’s collapse, former Federal Reserve Chairman Alan Greenspan testified before the US Congress that he had “found a flaw” in the ideology that self-interest would protect society from the financial system’s excesses.
But the damage had already been done.
That belief can be traced to prevailing economic theory concerning the causes of asset-price instability – a theory that accounts for risk and asset-price fluctuations as if the future followed mechanically from the past.
Contemporary economists’ mechanical models imply that self-interested market participants would not bid housing and other asset prices to clearly excessive levels in the run-up to the crisis.
Consequently, such excessive fluctuations have been viewed as a symptom of market participants’ irrationality.
This flawed assumption – that self-interested decisions can be adequately portrayed with mechanical rules – underpinned the creation of synthetic financial instruments and legitimized, on supposedly scientific grounds, their marketing to pension funds and other financial institutions around the world.
Remarkably, emerging economies with relatively less developed financial markets escaped many of the more egregious consequences of such innovations.
Contemporary economists’ reliance on mechanical rules to understand – and influence – economic outcomes extends to macroeconomic policy as well, and often draws on an authority, John Maynard Keynes, who would have rejected their approach.
Keynes understood early on the fallacy of applying such mechanical rules.
“We have involved ourselves in a colossal muddle,” he warned, “having blundered in the control of a delicate machine, the working of which we do not understand.”
In The General Theory of Employment, Interest, and Money, Keynes sought to provide the missing rationale for relying on expansionary fiscal policy to steer advanced capitalist economies out of the Great Depression.
But, following World War II, his successors developed a much more ambitious agenda.
Instead of pursuing measures to counter excessive fluctuations in economic activity, such as the deep contraction of the 1930’s, so-called stabilization policies focused on measures that aimed to maintain full employment.
The “New Keynesian” models underpinning these policies assumed that an economy’s “true” potential – and thus the so-called output gap that expansionary policy is supposed to fill to attain full employment – can be precisely measured.
But, to put it bluntly, the belief that an economist can fully specify in advance how aggregate outcomes – and thus the potential level of economic activity – unfold over time is bogus.
The projections implied by the Fed’s macro-econometric model concerning the timing and effects of the 2008 economic stimulus on unemployment, which have been notoriously wide of the mark, are a case in point.
Yet the mainstream of the economics profession insists that such mechanistic models retain validity.
Nobel laureate economist Paul Krugman, for example, claims that “a back-of-the-envelope calculation” on the basis of “textbook macroeconomics” indicates that the $800 billion US fiscal stimulus in 2009 should have been three times bigger.
Clearly, we need a new textbook.
The question is not whether fiscal stimulus helped, or whether a larger stimulus would have helped more, but whether policymakers should rely on any model that assumes that the future follows mechanically from the past.
For example, the housing-market collapse that left millions of US homeowners underwater is not part of textbook models, but it made precise calculations of fiscal stimulus based on them impossible.
The public should be highly suspicious of claims that such models provide any scientific basis for economic policy.
But to renounce what Friedrich von Hayek called economists’“pretense of exact knowledge” is not to abandon the possibility that economic theory can inform policymaking.
Indeed, recognizing ever-imperfect knowledge on the part of economists, policymakers, and market participants has important implications for our understanding of financial instability and the state’s role in mitigating it.
Asset-price swings arise not because market participants are irrational, but because they are attempting to cope with their ever-imperfect knowledge of the future stream of profits from alternative investment projects.
Market instability is thus integral to how capitalist economies allocate their savings.
Given this, policymakers should intervene not because they have superior knowledge about asset values (in fact, no one does), but because profit-seeking market participants do not internalize the huge social costs associated with excessive upswings and downswings in prices.
It is such excessive fluctuations, not deviations from some fanciful “true” value – whether of assets or of the unemployment rate – that Keynes believed policymakers should seek to mitigate.
Unlike their successors, Keynes and Hayek understood that imperfect knowledge and non-routine change mean that policy rules, together with the variables underlying them, gain and lose relevance at times that no one can anticipate.
That view appears to have returned to policymaking in Keynes’s homeland.
As Mervyn King, the former governor of the Bank of England, put it, “Our understanding of the economy is incomplete and constantly evolving... To describe monetary policy in terms of a constant rule derived from a known model of the economy is to ignore this process of learning.”
His successor, Mark Carney, has come to embody this view, eschewing fixed policy rules in favor of the constrained discretion implied by guidance ranges for key indicators.
Rather than trying to hit precise numerical targets, whether for inflation or unemployment, policymaking in this mode attempts to dampen excessive fluctuations.
It thus responds to actual problems, not to theories and rules (which these problems may have rendered obsolete).
If we are honest about the causes of the 2008 crisis – and serious about avoiding its recurrence – we must accept what economic analysis cannot deliver in order to benefit from what it can.

A Fateful Mistake
PARIS – Controversy is essential to the advancement of science.
So the debunking of methodological flaws and a coding error in a paper by the economists Carmen Reinhart and Kenneth Rogoff is just part of everyday life in academia.
Yet coverage of the controversy by the news media and the blogosphere has been astonishingly intense – and simplistic.
“Growth in a Time of Debt,” the short 2010 paper in which Reinhart and Rogoff claimed that public debt starts to have a significantly detrimental effect on economic growth once it reaches 90% of GDP, was never a celebrated piece of economic research.
As a rough empirical characterization of stylized facts, it was received somewhat skeptically by the academic community, and both authors were known for much more noted contributions.
Google Scholar, the academic search engine, records more than 3,000 academic citations of Rogoff’s most cited paper, compared to less than 500 for “Growth in a Time of Debt.”
What would have normally remained a subject for post-seminar small talk has, however, become a topic for discussion by journalists, commentators, and policymakers.
For all of them, what matters is that the sorry fate of the Reinhart/Rogoff paper undermines the case for fiscal austerity.
A few months ago, Olivier Blanchard, the International Monetary Fund’s chief economist, had already criticized his colleagues and policymakers in advanced countries for systematically underestimating the recessionary impact of fiscal consolidation programs.
The debacle of the Reinhart/Rogoff paper is widely regarded as another, fatal illustration of austerity’s shaky intellectual foundations.
But this is only partly true.
Until the Reinhart/Rogoff paper, the main argument for fiscal retrenchment rested on concerns about the sustainability of public debt.
The question was whether a sovereign would ultimately be able to repay its debt, given specific economic and financial conditions, long-term trends such as the aging of the population, and uncertainty about the future course of policy.
The problem was that economists were unable to say how much is too much.
There was no given threshold below which debt was innocuous and above which it was dangerous.
So the message to policymakers was confusing.
Economists were like doctors telling patients that, while some wine may be beneficial, too much is certainly dangerous –without being able to tell them how many glasses per day they were allowed.
They were right, but hopelessly imprecise.
Confusion was especially acute in early 2010, when “Growth in a Time of Debt” was published.
The global economy was just emerging from the deepest recession in the post-World War II period.
A global Keynesian stimulus had prevented the worst, and the most urgent policy question was whether to continue supporting the economy or start consolidating.
Some argued in favor of delaying consolidation, because the economy was still in a deep recession; too harsh an adjustment, according to this view, would have a major impact on a still-weak private economy.
Some claimed the opposite, arguing that, given the scale of the task, there was no time to lose.
The Reinhart/Rogoff paper appeared to provide the perfect argument in support of rapid consolidation, which is why it was cited intensively in policy discussions.
Austerity, it was argued, was needed to stem the rise in the debt ratio and safeguard long-term growth.
To be sure, retrenchment could entail some short-term costs; but the longer-term benefits would be much bigger.
Even though Reinhart and Rogoff themselves did not draw that conclusion explicitly in their paper, many drew it for them.
It was so tempting for a minister or a senior technocrat to explain that consolidation had to start immediately, because the 90% threshold was approaching, that most of them did not resist it.
Heavy reliance on what turns out to be disputed evidence now leaves the fiscal hawks in a weak position, to say the least, vis-à-vis their opponents. This is especially true in Europe.
Having promised that rapid consolidation would be good for growth, and having delivered recession, the European Union has disappointed its citizens.
Adjustment fatigue is setting in, and governments risk losing support if they go much further in their consolidation efforts.
The danger is that the discrediting of hasty austerity could undermine the case for fiscal responsibility in the long run.
If so, financial markets could conclude that public-debt sustainability is in serious danger – a perception that could have highly adverse effects on financing conditions.
In the end, growth would indeed suffer, ironically proving Reinhart and Rogoff right.
This episode once again underscores the importance of intellectual rigor.
Of course, that is not always an easy credo by which to abide.
Researchers are tempted by persuasive results that can attract the interest of policymakers, who are tempted by a selective reading of the evidence that can provide them with ammunition in domestic and international debate.
Submitting to either temptation, as the Reinhart/Rogoff episode has shown, is never advisable.

The Euro’s Imagined Community
NEW HAVEN – Great significance – probably too much – has been attached to a possible breakup of the eurozone.
Many believe that such a breakup – if, say, Greece abandoned the euro and reintroduced the drachma – would constitute a political failure that would ultimately threaten Europe’s stability.
Speaking before the Bundestag last October, German Chancellor Angela Merkel put the matter starkly:
“Nobody should believe that another half-century of peace and prosperity in Europe is guaranteed.
It is not.
So I say: If the euro fails, Europe fails.
That must not happen.
We have a historical obligation to protect by all prudent means at our disposal Europe’s unification process begun by our forefathers more than fifty years ago after centuries of hatred and spilling of blood.
None of us can foresee what the consequences would be if we were to fail.”
Europe has had more than 250 wars since the beginning of the Renaissance in the mid-fifteenth century.
So, it is not alarmist to worry aloud about preserving the sense of community that Europe has enjoyed for the past half-century.
In a fascinating, but largely overlooked book, How Enemies Become Friends, Charles A. Kupchan reviews many historical case studies of how nation-states with a long history of conflict managed eventually to become secure and peaceful friends.
His examples include the formation of the Swiss Confederation (1291-1848); the creation of the Iroquois Confederation in the century or so before the first Europeans arrived in America; the establishment of the United States (1776-1789); the unification of Italy (1861), and of Germany (1871); the Norway-Sweden rapprochement (1905-1935); the formation of the United Arab Emirates (1971); and the Argentine-Brazilian rapprochement of the 1970’s.
Kupchan also examines some notable failures of friendship:the United States’ Civil War (1861-65); the end of the Anglo-Japanese Alliance (1923); the breakdown of Sino-Soviet relations (1960); the demise of the United Arab Republic (1961);and the expulsion of Singapore from Malaysia (1965).
Kupchan never mentions a common currency as a condition of comity among nations; in fact, economic integration tends to follow, rather than precede, achievement of political unity.
Rather, he regards diplomatic engagement as the essential element to strategic accommodation and mutual trust, and this is more easily accomplished if the states have similar social orders and ethnicities.
But Kupchan’s analysis implies that a common currency can help nation-states to build lasting friendships, for he argues that friendship-building is most secure after an identity-changing “narrative” takes root, leading to a sense that the nations are like members of a family.
A common currency can help to generate such a narrative.
For example, the Iroquois tell the story of a great warrior and skilled orator named Hiawatha, who, traveling with the mystic Deganawidah, negotiated the treaties that established their confederation.
He advocated new condolence ceremonies to commemorate lost warriors – and to replace wars of vengeance.
The new narrative was reinforced with physical symbols, akin to a currency or a flag, in the form of belts of beads made of wampum, the Iroquois’ money.
A surviving Hiawatha belt, dating from the eighteenth century (and probably a copy of earlier belts), contains symbols of the five nations – Seneca, Cayuga, Onondaga, Oneida, and Mohawk –much as the US flag contains stars representing each of its states.
The belt also preserves Hiawatha’s status as the confederation’s forefather.
Flags may be a more inspiring symbol of common destiny, but most of us do not carry them around, and many people never display them, except perhaps at major sports events; their origin, rooted in battle standards, can seem uncomfortably aggressive.
There is a European Union flag, but it is rarely seen anywhere but outside of EU government buildings.
A British schoolteacher expressed the sentiment well in 1910: “We suspect the man who talks patriotism and imperialism, just as we suspect him who talks religion or any of the things that are of deepest value in life.
We think him either a humbug or a shallow person who has not realized the inadequacy of words to express what is deepest.”
And yet national currency, which we display every time we make a cash purchase, arouses no such suspicions.
So currency works as a constant, if latent, reminder of identity.
In using it, one has the psychological experience of participating with others in a common venture, and thus developing a sense of trust in both the endeavor and one’s fellow-participants.
Every currency union chooses symbols of common cultural values for its coins and notes, and these symbols become part of the sense of shared identity.
We see the human faces on the notes so often that they come to seem like family, creating what the political scientist Benedict Anderson called the “imagined community” that underlies and sustains a sense of nationhood.
The euro notes feature bridges as they appeared throughout Europe in various epochs, rather than images of actual structures that might seem to imply preferential regard for some countries.
The town of Spijkenisse in the Netherlands is now in the process of building all seven bridges depicted on the euro notes.
But the bridges remain symbols of European culture, in which presumably all Europeans share.
Modern electronic technology will not eliminate paper notes and coins soon, so there is still plenty of time to make use of the symbolic value of a common currency.
Indeed, even if the eurozone breaks up, each European country could adopt a different currency but retain common symbols.
For example, there could be a Greek euro, a Spanish euro, etc.
The notes could even show the same pictures of bridges.
Even electronic transactions should be able to generate symbols of peace, trust, and unity.
The point is that if Europe can keep these symbols alive, even a eurozone breakup would not have the dire political consequences for Europe that so many predict.

Nevertheless, I was not expecting a bubble story when I visited Colombia last month.
But, once again, people there told me about an ongoing real-estate bubble, and my driver showed me around the seaside resort town of Cartagena, pointing out, with a tone of amazement, several homes that had recently sold for millions of dollars.
The Banco de la República, Colombia’s central bank, maintains a home price index for three main cities – Bogotá, Medellín, and Cali.
The index has risen 69% in real (inflation-adjusted) terms since 2004, with most of the increase coming after 2007.
That rate of price growth recalls the US experience, with the S&P/Case-Shiller Ten-City Home Price Index for the US rising 131% in real terms from its bottom in 1997 to its peak in 2006.
This raises the question: just what is a speculative bubble?
The Oxford English Dictionary defines a bubble as “anything fragile, unsubstantial, empty, or worthless; a deceptive show.
From 17th c. onwards often applied to delusive commercial or financial schemes.”
The problem is that words like “show” and “scheme” suggest a deliberate creation, rather than a widespread social phenomenon that is not directed by any impresario.
Maybe the word bubble is used too carelessly.
Eugene Fama certainly thinks so.
Fama, the most important proponent of the “efficient markets hypothesis,” denies that bubbles exist. As he put it in a 2010 interview with John Cassidy for The New Yorker, “I don’t even know what a bubble means.
These words have become popular.
I don’t think they have any meaning.”
In the second edition of my book Irrational Exuberance, I tried to give a better definition of a bubble.
A “speculative bubble,” I wrote then, is “a situation in which news of price increases spurs investor enthusiasm, which spreads by psychological contagion from person to person, in the process amplifying stories that might justify the price increase.”
This attracts “a larger and larger class of investors, who, despite doubts about the real value of the investment, are drawn to it partly through envy of others’ successes and partly through a gambler’s excitement.”
That seems to be the core of the meaning of the word as it is most consistently used.
Implicit in this definition is a suggestion about why it is so difficult for “smart money” to profit by betting against bubbles: the psychological contagion promotes a mindset that justifies the price increases, so that participation in the bubble might be called almost rational.
But it is not rational.
The story in every country is different, reflecting its own news, which does not always jibe with news in other countries.
For example, the current story in Colombia appears to be that the country’s government, now under the well-regarded management of President Juan Manuel Santos, has brought down inflation and interest rates to developed-country levels, while all but eliminating the threat posed by the FARC rebels, thereby injecting new vitality into the Colombian economy.
That is a good enough story to drive a housing bubble.
Because bubbles are essentially social-psychological phenomena, they are, by their very nature, difficult to control.
Regulatory action since the financial crisis might diminish bubbles in the future. But public fear of bubbles may also enhance psychological contagion, fueling even more self-fulfilling prophecies.
One problem with the word bubble is that it creates a mental picture of an expanding soap bubble, which is destined to pop suddenly and irrevocably.
But speculative bubbles are not so easily ended; indeed, they may deflate somewhat, as the story changes, and then reflate.
It would seem more accurate to refer to these episodes as speculative epidemics.
We know from influenza that a new epidemic can suddenly appear just as an older one is fading, if a new form of the virus appears, or if some environmental factor increases the contagion rate.
Similarly, a new speculative bubble can appear anywhere if a new story about the economy appears, and if it has enough narrative strength to spark a new contagion of investor thinking.
This is what happened in the bull market of the 1920’s in the US, with the peak in 1929.
We have distorted that history by thinking of bubbles as a period of dramatic price growth, followed by a sudden turning point and a major and definitive crash.
In fact, a major boom in real stock prices in the US after “Black Tuesday” brought them halfway back to 1929 levels by 1930.
This was followed by a second crash, another boom from 1932 to 1937, and a third crash.
Speculative bubbles do not end like a short story, novel, or play.
There is no final denouement that brings all the strands of a narrative into an impressive final conclusion.
In the real world, we never know when the story is over.

Going Against Conventional Wisdom
CAMBRIDGE – When I finished my graduate studies in 1974, I had the wonderful fortune of doing postdoctoral work with Harvard Medical School’s Judah Folkman.
Dr. Folkman had a theory that the progression of tumors could be arrested by cutting off their source of nourishment.
He suggested that tumors emit a substance called tumor-angiogenesis factor, which causes surrounding blood vessels to grow toward it, supplying nutrition and removing waste.
Folkman hypothesized that this process, angiogenesis, is crucial to the tumor’s survival.
This theory went strongly against conventional wisdom.
Scientists who reviewed Folkman’s grants said that the new blood vessels were simply due to inflammation.
But Folkman persevered, and eventually he proved that such chemical substances do exist.
Today, four decades later, such substances have been used to treat more than 10 million people with neovascular diseases such as macular degeneration and many different forms of cancer.
I had a similar experience when I was working in his lab, trying to isolate the first inhibitors of blood-vessel growth (which were large-molecular-weight substances).
This required developing a bioassay that would enable us to observe the inhibition of blood-vessel growth in the presence of tumors.
Given that tumors take several months to grow, biocompatible systems had to be developed that could release proteins and other large-molecular-weight substances slowly and continuously in the body – something that scientists were convinced was impossible.
However, after two years of work, I discovered that I could modify certain types of polymers to release molecules of virtually any size over a 100-day period.
For several years, many of the field’s most respected chemists and engineers said that our work had to be incorrect.
The negative feedback had practical consequences, inhibiting my ability not only to secure research grants, but also to find faculty positions (especially given the work’s interdisciplinary nature, which made it difficult to fit into a single university department).
But I kept at it, and, step by step, addressed different key issues – such as biocompatibility, manufacturing, reproducibility of release, and bioactivity.
Today, systems based on these principles have been used to treat more than 20 million people.
Another area I started thinking about involved creating new polymer materials.
Working in a hospital, I saw that almost all polymers used in medicine were derived from household objects.
For example, the materials used in girdles for women are used in artificial hearts because of their good flex life.
The polymers in mattress stuffing are used in breast implants.
Yet such an approach often leads to problems.
Artificial hearts, for example, can cause clots to form when blood hits their surface – the girdle material – and these clots can cause strokes and death.
So I began thinking that we needed to find alternatives to solving medical problems other than by searching for materials in everyday settings.
I believed that researchers could take an engineering-design approach: Ask the question, “What do we really want in a biomaterial from the standpoints of engineering, chemistry, and biology?” and then synthesize the materials from first principles.
As a proof of principle, we decided to synthesize a new family of biodegradable polymers, called polyanhydrides, for medical use.
The first step was to select monomers – a polymer’s building blocks – that would be safe in the human body.
We then synthesized these polymers and discovered that by changing their composition, we could make them last in the body for a period ranging from days to years.
With Henry Brem, now the chief of neurosurgery at Johns Hopkins Hospital, we thought we could use these polymers to deliver drugs locally in the treatment of brain cancer.
But I had to raise money for this project, so I wrote grant applications to government agencies that were reviewed by other professors.
Their reviews were very negative.
In our first grant proposal, in 1981, the reviewers said that we would never be able to synthesize the polymers.
Yet one of my graduate students synthesized the polymers for his doctoral thesis.
We sent the proposal back for another review, only to be told that the grant should still not be funded, because the polymers would react with whatever drug we wanted to deliver.
Several researchers in our lab showed that there was no reaction.
We returned the proposal for another review; it came back with the comment that the polymers were fragile and would break.
This time, two other researchers addressed the problem.
The revised proposal was sent again for evaluation, and now the reviewers’ reason for rejecting it was that new polymers would not be safe to test on animals or people.
Another graduate student showed that the polymers were safe.
Such reviews continued for a long time; but, in 1996, the Food and Drug Administration approved the treatment – the first new treatment for brain cancer to be approved in more than 20 years.
Moreover, the FDA’s approval of polymer-based local chemotherapy created a new paradigm in the drug-delivery field, helping to pave the way for drug-eluting stents and other local delivery systems.
Something similar happened when Jay Vacanti, a surgeon at Massachusetts General Hospital, and I had an idea in the 1980’s to combine three-dimensional synthetic polymer scaffolds with cells to create new tissues and organs.
Once again, the idea was met with great skepticism, and it was extremely difficult to obtain peer-reviewed government grants.
Today, this concept has become a cornerstone of tissue engineering and regenerative medicine, leading to the creation of artificial skin for patients with burns or skin ulcers – and someday, one hopes, to the creation of many other tissues and organs.
My experiences are hardly unique.
Scientists throughout history have often had to fight conventional wisdom to validate their discoveries.
In modern times, Stanley Prusiner’s discovery of prions, Barry Marshall and Robin Warren’s findings that bacteria can cause peptic ulcers, and Dan Shechtman’s determination of the structure of quasi crystals are just a few examples (all received Nobel Prizes for their research).
The lessons are simple to understand, if difficult to master: Don’t believe everything you read, be willing to challenge dogma, and recognize that you may pay a price for it career-wise in the short run, even if you are correct.
But the rewards of scientific discovery are worth it:technology advances, and the world can become much better for it.

The Post-Crisis Global Economy in Three Words
PARIS – Five years have passed since the collapse of the American investment bank Lehman Brothers triggered financial mayhem and marked the onset of the Great Recession.
Though the dust may not have fully settled, three catchwords sum up what we have learned so far – and what remains to be done.
The first word that comes to mind is resilience.
Five years ago, many feared a repetition of the Great Depression of the 1930’s.
Indeed, as Barry Eichengreen and Kevin O’Rourke have shown, the collapse of world industrial production in 2008-2009 initially tracked that of 1929-1930 very well.
The fall in world trade volume and equity indices was even faster.
Fortunately, the historical paths subsequently diverged.
Five years after the 1929 crash, the world was still in depression and trade had contracted sharply.
Today, the United States is still going through its worst employment recession since World War II, and Europe’s GDP has not returned to pre-crisis levels, but global output has grown 15% since 2008, and world trade is up more than 12%.
The world avoided a Great Depression II mainly because there was no global financial crisis this time.
What occurred in 2008 was a US crisis that contaminated Europe, because the two financial systems were almost completely integrated.
The rest of the world, however, was largely immune.
China and other emerging countries were hit by a severe demand shock that affected their exports, but not by the financial turmoil.
On the contrary, the value of US government bonds that China and others held rose in response to the drop in interest rates.
Another reason for the rebound was the well-timed response engineered in 2009 by the G-20.
For the first time, emerging and developing countries participated in a coordinated reflation effort, and, alongside their advanced-country counterparts, promised to resist trade protectionism.
The recovery soon demonstrated that the global economy had more than one engine.
This gave the US economy time to heal, and even made it possible for Europe to experience its own crisis without triggering a generalized downturn.
The second word that characterizes the last five years is acceleration.
In 2008, everyone knew that the rise of emerging and developing countries was redrawing the global economic map.
But this was thought to be a gradual, long-term trend.
In reality, what was supposed to take one or two decades took just five years.
A simple statistic illustrates the point: in 2007, the advanced countries accounted for almost three-quarters of the G-20’s combined GDP.
By 2012, their share had fallen to 63%.
The combination of growth differentials and high oil and raw-materials prices has resulted in a massive shift in the distribution of world income.
Furthermore, all advanced countries have experienced rapid deterioration in their public finances.
Whereas ten years ago public-debt crises were considered a plague that afflicts developing countries, the malady is now the advanced economies’ curse.
According to the International Monetary Fund, the average debt/GDP ratio at the end of 2012 was 110% in the advanced countries, but just 35% for emerging countries and 42% for low-income countries.
Of course, such statistics can be misleading.
The US and Europe still enjoy the services of a vast capital stock – machines, buildings, and public infrastructure built over decades or even centuries.
Furthermore, immaterial capital increasingly matters, too:US authorities recently revised GDP upward by $400 billion after recognizing that research and development spending should be categorized as investment.
Emerging countries may be growing faster, but their per capita capital stock still does not match that of advanced countries (in fact, this is precisely what development is largely about).
Nonetheless, global politics is one field in which relative income changes and the poor state of rich countries’ public finances matter.
When the US and Europe threatened to withdraw financial support from Egypt in order to influence the behavior of the country’s military leadership, they soon realized that Saudi Arabia and other Gulf states could be much more convincing, because they had much deeper pockets.
This leads to the third catchword of the last five years:rebalancing.
Globalization 1.0 was built around US consumers and Chinese producers.
The next phase should be built around consumers and producers the world over.
According to projections by Homi Kharas and Geoffrey Gertz of the Brookings Institution, there now are 700 million more people with $10-100 per day to spend than there were in 2003.
Moreover, what they call the global middle class is expected to grow by another 1.3 billion over the next ten years.
So there is obvious potential for a major rebalancing toward consumption-led growth in the emerging and developing world.
This new phase of globalization portends major benefits for the global economy.
Instead of the somewhat one-sided trade pattern of the last two decades, it means greater well-being for households in developing countries and opportunities for more producers in the advanced economies.
At the same time, consumption habits will need to change everywhere: the middle class cannot triple in size and continue to rely on the same energy- and carbon-intensive spending patterns.
But we are not there yet.
Partly owing to government stimulus measures, China’s growth since 2008 has been driven more by investment than by consumption, which has impeded the economy’s much-needed demand rebalancing.
Economic performance has been sustained by a partly artificial investment boom, which is now petering out – raising concerns about China’s ability to maintain sufficiently rapid growth.
And demand is still much too energy- and carbon-intensive.
So a transition remains to be managed, and recent foreign-exchange turmoil in several emerging countries indicates that it is bound to be a delicate one.
The resilience that the world economy has shown since 2008 provides reason to rejoice, and the acceleration of changes in the global balance of economic and financial strength is reason to reflect.
But the remaining challenge of rebalancing demand (in both quantitative and qualitative terms) remains a major one.
Until progress toward meeting it is further advanced, it will be too early to claim victory.

The Regional Route to Global Free Trade
MADRID – With the moribund Doha Round of multilateral free-trade talks awaiting its last rites, a new wave of regional trade negotiations has de facto taken up the mantle of establishing a global trade regime.
President Barack Obama’s administration has placed the United States at the center of this shift, embracing two major simultaneous negotiations: the Transatlantic Trade and Investment Partnership (TTIP) with the European Union; and the Trans-Pacific Partnership (TPP) with 11 countries in the Americas and Asia.
As the only party to both initiatives, the US is well placed either to move them forward in harmony or to leverage the progress of one negotiation against the other.
Beyond affecting America’s immediate negotiating partners, the latter approach would gravely damage progress in establishing a rule-based global system.
The new strategy of regional negotiations can succeed and provide a foundation upon which an international trading regime can be built only if the TTIP and the TPP are balanced and approachable to the wider international community.
Otherwise, there is the danger of creating expensive global imbalances and even fragmentation.
Europe has an important role to play in this regard.
Broadening the discussion beyond a focus on the big two agreements – and beyond some of their substantive issues – will create a sense of urgency and purpose, pushing the US to engage actively or risk losing its central role in the global trade agenda.
The EU is well placed to foster a conducive atmosphere by parlaying its existing trade partnerships, beginning with TPP members Mexico and Chile, with which it has longstanding free-trade agreements, and Singapore, with which it recently completed free-trade negotiations.
More significant are Europe’s other ongoing trade negotiations, which could be used to push the TPP/TTIP agenda forward.
The EU-Canada talks, which should become a building block for harmonizing the TTIP and the TPP, have stalled and must be revitalized.
Even smaller ongoing negotiations, like those with Malaysia and Vietnam, offer some opportunity.
Most important, however, are the recently launched EU-Japan free trade talks.
Europe and Japan are both facing difficult challenges, including rapidly aging populations and sputtering economies.
Yet Japan enjoys the significant advantage of national cohesiveness, which occasionally allows for the type of bold and decisive action lacking in Europe.
This assertiveness has been on full display under Prime Minister Shinzo Abe, who has vowed to attack Japan’s prolonged economic morass using “three arrows”: expansionary monetary policy, aggressive fiscal policy, and structural reform.
Abe’s determined pursuit of the first two prongs has been well documented.
Structural reform, however, is a more difficult proposition, with strongly entrenched interests and cultural values militating against change and opening up a partly closed economy.
Indeed, the OECD ranks Japan last among member states in terms of regulatory restrictiveness with respect to inward foreign direct investment.
The Abe government has touted trade agreements as a good way to push through needed reforms, and, although it is too soon to know what Japan’s true position will be, indications are that it is a motivated negotiator.
For Europe, which is seeking to expand its footprint in Asia, a strong link with a reformed Japanese economy would be a boon.
Indeed, investment in Japan currently accounts for less than 3% of the EU’s total outward FDI.
More significant, an engaged Japan that is willing to reach a deal will be a useful ally in pushing a forward-thinking and balanced trade agenda, particularly as the TTIP and the TPP appear headed for difficult waters.
Japan’s entry into the TPP this spring was a game changer.
With a GDP matching that of all other TPP partners combined (with the exception of the US), Japan adds significant economic heft.
But it also brings added complexity, reflected in the reluctance shown by the US Congress immediately after Japan announced its desire to join the TPP negotiations, as well as in recent comments by American auto executives.
The TPP is already in its 18th round of discussions, and, with some rumblings that China may join the negotiations, it appears that the talks will be prolonged significantly.
Meanwhile, the euphoria that surrounded the TTIP in February, when Obama included it in his State of the Union address, has faded.
Talk of “one tank of gas” has been drowned out by the drumbeat of l’exception culturelle and the revelations of US spying on Europe made by the rogue American intelligence contractor Edward Snowden.
The EU-Japan negotiations could be lithe in comparison.
The bilateral nature of the talks makes them less unwieldy than the ever-expanding TPP.
The disparity between the parties in terms of economic size– the EU’s GDP is almost three times larger than Japan’s – is not so wide as to lead to the strong-arm tactics seen in the EU-Canada talks (a relationship in which Europe has a tenfold advantage in terms of output).
Moreover, the EU-Japan talks lack the historical, cultural, and emotional baggage of the transatlantic relationship, and relatively subdued attention to them provides an easier environment in which to hash out difficult issues, such as government procurement and food safety.
Trade negotiations are never easy, and the EU-Japan talks will be no exception.
But if these two big players, both struggling to regain their luster, recognize the potential for the talks to be an engine for global trade reform, vital political will could and should be generated – particularly if European officials can develop a bit of Abe’s boldness.
If we are to keep this de facto regional trade round moving forward, we need more than just the TTIP and the TPP to do the peddling.

South Africa’s Winnable AIDS Battle
ERFURT – In the battle against HIV/AIDS, South Africa was for many years the perfect example of what not to do.
Until recently, the government’s response to the epidemic, which threatened the country’s very lifeblood, was lackluster and foolish.
But rising pressure over the past two decades – from civil-society groups, the media, and more enlightened politicians –is finally showing results.
A disease that has inflicted profound social and economic pain, and dramatically reduced life expectancy, appears to be in retreat.
But a new UN report suggests that South Africa’s battle against the virus is far from over.
The country has the world’s most severe HIV problem, with some 5.6 million citizens – more than 10% of the population –currently living with the virus.
Every year, around 300,000 new infections, and 270,000 AIDS-related deaths, are recorded.
HIV/AIDS patients are also prone to other infections: an estimated 70% of South Africans with AIDS also contract tuberculosis, while half of those carrying the HIV virus are expected to do so during their lifetime.
Worse, a third of pregnant women – a highly AIDS-prone demographic – have been diagnosed with the virus, which can be passed on to their babies during childbirth.
The ferociousness of the disease, and the speed at which it spread, took many South Africans by surprise.
As in developed countries, HIV infections initially were concentrated among hemophiliacs, sexually active gay men, and intravenous drug users.
But, during the 1990’s, and for reasons that are still not fully understood, the virus exploded into the general population.
The number of infected South Africans (equivalent to the population of Denmark) outstrips that of neighboring Mozambique, Lesotho, Botswana, Namibia, Swaziland, and Zimbabwe combined.
Yet, incredibly, the rapid spread of HIV and the rising toll of AIDS-related deaths failed to galvanize the country’s post-apartheid leaders, especially former President Thabo Mbeki, into meaningful action.
For years, the top ranks of the governing Africa National Congress seemed to be in denial over the pervasiveness of HIV/AIDS and how best to combat it.
Civil-society organizations were not so complacent, using the courts, the media, and civil disobedience to lobby for change.
Although contradictory views about how to treat HIV persisted, at least antiretroviral therapy has been available in some public facilities over the past decade.
But a more coherent and consistent approach evolved following the appointment of Aaron Motsoaledi as Minister of Health in 2009.
The South African National Department of Health and private health-care providers now report that conditions are no longer so desperate.
Three approaches have helped to contain the spread: the provision of antiretroviral therapy by the government and donor agencies; better treatment of tuberculosis patients, who tend to contract HIV/AIDS as well; and a greatly expanded program to prevent mother-to-child transmission.
These remedies have reduced the rate of new infections (though the total number of people living with HIV, especially aged 15-49, continues to rise).
With almost two million patients now on antiretroviral treatment, annual AIDS-related deaths have fallen by around 100,000 since 2005.
Contagion among newborn babies, once running at around 70,000 per year, have been cut by some 63%, and the lives of millions of HIV/AIDS sufferers have been prolonged.
Another important factor has been better integration of treatment plans.
The government has aligned its early antiretroviral treatment programs for existing sufferers, initiated in 2008, with early monitoring programs for pregnant women.
New, more effective treatment to prevent tuberculosis, especially the multi drug-resistant strains, has also helped.
More can and must be done.
Newborn infections, for example, could be further reduced by encouraging more pregnant mothers to visit health clinics for early monitoring and for checkups after delivery.
But progress to date should be acknowledged, if not celebrated.
The recent successes demonstrate that with political will and sufficient resources, even the greatest of scourges can be beaten – a lesson not only for South Africa but also for countries elsewhere in Africa and the developing world.

Who Will Decide Venezuela’s Election?
PRAGUE – Venezuela’s presidential election campaign is in full swing, with voters expected to go to the polls on October 7 to elect their head of state.
The campaign pits Henrique Capriles Radonski, the governor of the state of Miranda, against the incumbent president, Hugo Chávez, who has been in power since 1999.
What makes this election unique, in our view, is that for the first time, Chávez, who is seeking an unprecedented fourth consecutive term in office, faces a credible challenger in Capriles, who has managed to unite disparate opposition political parties under his banner.
In fact, some recent polls have put Chávez only slightly more than three percentage points ahead of Capriles.
That is certainly good news for Venezuela’s fledgling democracy, and raises hopes for a genuine democratic contest.
Nevertheless, we believe that it is necessary to express our concern about the precarious state of affairs in Venezuela on the eve of the vote.
If anything, the situation in the country is marked by a high degree of uncertainty, because no one knows to what lengths Chávez might go to retain his grip on power.
What is clear is that the regime appears increasingly determined to ensure its survival by any means necessary.
Chávez has all the normal advantages of incumbency, but can also be expected to use every available administrative resource a this disposal to ensure re-election.
Moreover, a cloud of uncertainty hangs over the period following the October election; regardless of who wins, the president will face a daunting challenge in trying to restore normalcy to ordinary Venezuelans’ lives.
But that is for later.
Today, it is of paramount importance that the election be conducted in the most fair and transparent manner possible.
In the meantime, both the government and the opposition should be mindful of the many challenges in the run-up to the vote.
Unless these challenges are addressed in a responsible manner, there could be serious consequences for the country’s future.
Chávez’s health remains perhaps the biggest enigma of the upcoming election.
There are conflicting reports regarding his physical condition, with some presenting a grim prognosis.
His sudden departure due to illness might cause a political vacuum, which could become conducive to a power grab of one form or another, such as a military coup.
Strict adherence to constitutional provisions in any such eventuality is imperative.
Here, the lack of free media is especially alarming and does not bode well for a free and fair election.
It is essential that the opposition can freely air its message and target prospective voters – a point not lost on the Chávez regime as it seeks to curtail further the opposition’s ability to reach out to the electorate.
The recent attack on Globovision, Venezuela’s only surviving independent station, stands out in this regard.
The Supreme Court levied a prohibitive fine on Globovision for its coverage of the government’s handling of a recent prison mutiny.
As a result, the station’s future looks bleak.
To make matters worse, recent reports have emerged that regime loyalists have been meddling directly in opposition affairs in an effort to sow discord.
As recently as June 11, the Supreme Court ruled that Chávez’s allies could be installed at the helm of two political parties that previously opposed him.
Such blatantly underhanded tactics should be impermissible in a functioning democracy, and cast serious doubt on the regime’s claim to be upholding democratic standards.
We are strongly convinced that no matter who wins on October 7, the president-elect will need a free and fair vote to provide him with the credibility necessary to rally the public.
It is vital, therefore, that the government does not renege in any way on its promise in this regard.
The increasingly murky situation in Venezuela calls for unbiased and accurate reporting of campaign developments.
To that end, domestic and international media watchdogs must step up their efforts to expose attempts by the government to restrict the media’s ability to operate freely.
The authorities should permit media organizations to play their crucial role in informing Venezuelans and the outside world in an unbiased and accurate fashion.
In order to ensure a level playing field, the Venezuelan opposition should have equal access to media, and official attacks on media outlets must stop.
On Election Day itself, the opposition should be permitted to place observers at any and all polling stations without fear for their safety.
In addition, we appeal to the Venezuelan government to act in accordance with established practices and accept the presence of international election observers.
Finally, we encourage the international community to remain firm and persistent in demanding a free and fair election in October.

Why a More Flexible Renminbi Still Matters
CAMBRIDGE – One of the most notable macroeconomic developments in recent years has been the sharp drop in China’s current-account surplus.
The International Monetary Fund is now forecasting a 2012 surplus of just 2.3% of GDP, down from a pre-crisis peak of 10.1% of GDP in 2007, owing largely to a decline in China’s trade surplus– that is, the excess of the value of Chinese exports over that of its imports.
The drop has been a surprise to the many pundits and policy analysts who view China’s sustained massive trade surpluses as prima facie evidence that government intervention has been keeping the renminbi far below its unfettered “equilibrium” value.
Does the dramatic fall in China’s surplus call that conventional wisdom into question?
Should the United States, the IMF, and other players stop pressing China to move to a more flexible currency regime?
The short answer is “no.”
China’s economy is still plagued by massive imbalances, and moving to a more flexible exchange-rate regime would serve as a safety valve and shock absorber.
That said, the exchange rate has received far too much focus as a lightning rod for concerns over China’s growing engagement in the global economy.
The link between the exchange rate and China’s pricing advantages in world markets is wildly exaggerated.
At the same time, the exchange rate is by no means the most pressing macroeconomic problem facing China today.
Rather, the biggest concern is China’s chronic over-reliance on investment as a driver of growth.
Investment constitutes almost half of GDP, more than twice the global average.
At the same time, private consumption is under 40% of GDP, with 60% being a more normal figure for economies at similar levels of development.
China’s investment appetite is unquestionably driven by huge intervention in the financial system: small savers receive only a paltry 1-2% on their deposits in an economy that until recently has been registering 10% annual growth.
The dramatic fall in China’s current-account surplus reflects four main factors.
First, the cost of raw-material imports has risen sharply.
At the same time, foreign demand for China’s exports is sufficiently sensitive that it cannot simply pass on the entire added cost.
A second important factor has been slow growth in the advanced economies, a byproduct of the financial crisis that is likely to persist for some time to come.
Third, China’s trade-weighted real exchange rate (the exchange rate adjusted for inflation differentials) has actually appreciated quite a bit in the past few years – by 14% since 2008, according to IMF estimates.
China’s inflation has been higher than the average of its trading partners, and the renminbi has in fact strengthened gradually in nominal terms.
Finally, China engaged in massive investment stimulus as a response to the financial crisis.
China’s investment is far more import-intensive than its consumption, which has continued to trend downwards.
Countries like Germany and Switzerland have been huge beneficiaries of China’s seemingly insatiable appetite for high-tech capital equipment.
Setting aside all of these specific drivers, we should hardly be surprised that China’s current-account surplus collapsed in the wake of the global financial crisis.
With China continuing to record spectacular growth while the advanced economies were experiencing a deep slump, China’s exports, relative to imports, had nowhere to go but down.
Indeed, in retrospect, what is surprising is that China’s trade surplus did not shrink even more.
The IMF reasonably predicts that, as the global economy normalizes over the longer term, China’s current-account surplus will again occupy the same weight in global imbalances as it did a few years ago (about 0.5% of global GDP).
All of this underscores the point that there is no monotonic relationship between the exchange rate and the current account.
Capital-flow pressures, for example, can exert strong pressures of their own on exchange rates, independently of trade.
China has very strong capital controls, but they are far from impervious.
With the prospect of modest rates of return in advanced economies, China has inevitably become a more attractive investment destination, despite a significant risk that China will someday experience its own sharp slowdown and financial crisis.
(Those who think otherwise have succumbed to the “this time is different” mindset that Carmen Reinhart and I have emphasized in our research on financial crises through history.)
The real case for China moving to a more flexible exchange rate is that in any kind of crisis – economic, political, or otherwise – the exchange rate can provide an important stabilizer.
Even if the renminbi appreciated in the near term, the effect on trade would probably be far less than American authorities wish and Chinese authorities fear.
Studies on exchange rate pass-through suggest that US consumers would only see a small fraction of the cost change.
The simplistic logic often used to link the exchange rate and the current account is weak.
But the case for China’s move to a more flexible exchange-rate regime, as part of broader financial-market liberalization, remains strong.

Banking Reform’s Fear Factor
WASHINGTON, DC – Nearly five years after the worst financial crisis since the 1930’s, and three years after the enactment of the Dodd-Frank financial reforms in the United States, one question is on everyone’s mind: Why have we made so little progress?
New rules have been promised, but very few have actually been implemented.
There is not yet a “Volcker Rule” (limiting proprietary trading by banks), the rules for derivatives are still a work-in-progress, and money-market funds remain unreformed.
Even worse, our biggest banks have become even larger.
There is no sign that they have abandoned the incentive structure that encourages excessive risk-taking.
And the great distortions from being “too big to fail” loom large over many economies.
There are three possible explanations for what has gone wrong.
One is that financial reform is inherently complicated.
But, though many technical details need to be fleshed out, some of the world’s smartest people work in the relevant regulatory agencies.
They are more than capable of writing and enforcing rules –that is, when this is what they are really asked to do.
The second explanation focuses on conflict among agencies with overlapping jurisdictions, both within and across countries.
Again, there is an element of truth to this; but we have also seen a great deal of coordination even on the most complex topics – such as how much equity big banks should have, or how the potential failure of such a firm should be handled.
That leaves the final explanation: those in charge of financial reform really did not want to make rapid progress.
In both the US and Europe, government leaders are gripped by one overriding fear: that their economies will slip back into recession – or worse.
The big banks play on this fear, arguing that financial reform will cause them to become unprofitable and make them unable to lend, or that there will be some other dire unintended consequence.
There has been a veritable avalanche of lobbying on this point, which has resulted in top officials moving slowly, for fear of damaging the economy.
But this is a grave mistake – based on a failure to understand how big banks can damage the economy.
Higher equity-capital requirements, for example, require banks to fund themselves with relatively more equity and relatively less debt.
This makes them safer, because they are more able to absorb losses, and less likely to become zombie banks (which do not make sensible loans).
The banks claim that higher capital requirements and other regulations will drive up the cost of credit.
But there is no sign of any such effect – a point made, rather belatedly, in the Federal Reserve’s monetary policy report to the US Congress last week.
On the contrary, the biggest US banks are reporting very healthy profits for the last quarter.
Unfortunately, a big part of these banks’ profits stems from trading securities – exactly the sort of high-risk activity that got them into trouble in the run-up to the 2008 global financial crisis.
These are highly leveraged businesses, typically funding their balance sheets with no more than 5% equity (and thus 95% debt).
To understand why this is a problem, consider what happens when you buy a house with just 5% down (or less than 3% down, which is a better analogy for some European banks).
If house prices go up, you make a good return on your equity (and a better return than if you had put 20% down).
But if house prices go down, your equity may well be wiped out (which is what it means to be underwater on your mortgage).
Higher equity-capital requirements for banks are good for the broader economy – they make financial crises (and the zombie-syndrome) less likely, less severe, or both.
US banks are currently funded with more equity than was the case before the financial crisis, and they are doing fine.
Nonetheless, we should still worry about their ability to blow themselves up in a novel and creative fashion – hence the need for the Volcker Rule, derivatives reform, and new rules for money-market funds.
And equity-capital requirements for large, systemically important financial institutions remain too low.
The latest indications are that US policymakers are finally starting to focus on this point.
Many European banks, however, have less equity than their US counterparts, which creates an important source of vulnerability going forward.
If there is to be a broad-based European recovery, the banks must raise more equity, thereby strengthening their ability to absorb potential losses.
Unfortunately, there is little sign that European policymakers understand this point.
Instead, senior officials in Europe think and talk like US policymakers did three years ago.
They are wary of rocking the financial boat, so they go easy on financial reform and refuse to insist on more equity capital for banks.
This is a mistake that they – and possibly all of us – may come to regret.
