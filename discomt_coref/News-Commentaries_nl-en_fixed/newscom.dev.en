Immunization on the Front Line
MAPUTO – Most of the news one hears coming out of Mozambique is bad – poverty, disease, conflict, and floods.
But there are a lot of good things happening in my country, too.
In the past two decades, Mozambique has become a functioning democracy; grown its agriculture sector; raised literacy rates; increased water supply and electricity in rural areas; and reduced child mortality dramatically, from 219 per 1,000 live births in 1990, two years before the civil war ended, to 135 per 1,000 in 2010.
I am particularly proud of the last achievement, because, by working in partnership with my fellow Mozambicans to expand immunization coverage, I believe that I have played a part in bringing it about.
I grew up in Mozambique when the country was still under Portuguese rule, and the inequality in our colonial society shaped my view that all people have a right to health care.
I remember working at a pediatric ward as a teenager and watching children die from diseases like polio, measles, and tetanus – all easily prevented by vaccines.
The impact of that experience led me to spend the next 40 years working to ensure that every child in Mozambique, regardless of her ethnicity or where she lives, gets the vaccines that she needs to help her lead a long and healthy life.
In a few days, I will join 300 global leaders in Abu Dhabifor the world’s first vaccine summit – a gathering dedicated to ensuring that all children everywhere have access to vaccines.
People like Bill Gates and Kofi Annan will make the case that immunization programs deserve adequate funding and political support.
I don’t have an audience like Gates or Annan, but I would like to add my voice to theirs.
Millions of health workers like my colleagues and I make immunization their daily work.
We have made tremendous strides in reaching more children with more vaccines, which is why more children are surviving than ever before.
But there are still even more children to save, and we need help to do our work on the ground.
Because vaccines are useless if parents refuse to give them to their children, a big part of my job is to collaborate with health workers, community leaders, school teachers, and local political figures to educate parents about vaccines.
But having the community’s support is not enough.
It is also vital to ensure that vaccines get to the right place, at the right time, and in the right condition.
For example, in order to prevent shortages, Village Reach, the organization for which I work, helped to correct the population figures used to forecast the number of vaccines needed in each health center.
Village Reach also started a company that delivers propane gas to health centers in northern Mozambique, where, like in many of the country’s rural areas, electricity is unreliable or completely unavailable to power the refrigerators that keep vaccines cool.
Through the use of propane, we can ensure that the vaccines do not spoil during the journey from manufacturer to mother and child.
And once a month, we make sure that health workers deliver vaccines and other health services “the last mile” to mothers and children in remote rural areas.
Finally, I have learned that meticulous record-keeping and measuring results is critical to reaching more children.
That is why we are assessing different methods forgathering data from the field, including the use of mobile applications to digitize paper records.
Building these routine immunization systems has already helped us to eradicate diseases like polio and all but one type of measles.
Earlier this month, we used them to vaccinate children against pneumonia for the first time in Mozambique’s history, and we hope that next year we will begin to address rotavirus, which causes diarrhea and is the number one killer for children under five years old.
Our longer-term goal is to strengthen these systems enough to reach all children in Mozambique with basic vaccines and other forms of health care.
I believe that we can achieve this goal, because I have witnessed how far we have come already, despite our struggles.
Big challenges lie ahead, but I am confident that with the support of the global community, I can leave to my own children and community a thriving country where every person has the opportunity to prosper.

Germany’s Choice
FRANKFURT – The euro crisis has already transformed the European Union from a voluntary association of equal states into a creditor-debtor relationship from which there is no easy escape.
The creditors stand to lose large sums should a member state exit the monetary union, yet debtors are subjected to policies that deepen their depression, aggravate their debt burden, and perpetuate their subordinate position.
As a result, the crisis is now threatening to destroy the EU itself.
That would be a tragedy of historic proportions, which only German leadership can prevent.
The causes of the crisis cannot be properly understood without recognizing the euro’s fatal flaw: By creating an independent central bank, member countries have become indebted in a currency that they do not control.
At first, both the authorities and market participants treated all government bonds as if they were riskless, creating a perverse incentive for banks to load up on the weaker bonds.
When the Greek crisis raised the specter of default, financial markets reacted with a vengeance, relegating all heavily indebted euro zone members to the status of a Third World country over-extended in a foreign currency.
Subsequently, the heavily indebted member countries were treated as if they were solely responsible for their misfortunes, and the structural defect of the euro remained uncorrected.
Once this is understood, the solution practically suggests itself.
It can be summed up in one word: Eurobonds.
If countries that abide by the Eu’s new Fiscal Compact were allowed to convert their entire stock of government debt into Eurobonds, the positive impact would be little short of the miraculous.
The danger of default would disappear, as would risk premiums.
Banks’ balance sheets would receive an immediate boost, as would the heavily indebted countries’ budgets.
Italy, for example, would save up to 4% of its GDP; its budget would move into surplus; and fiscal stimulus would replace austerity.
As a result, its economy would grow, and its debt ratio would fall.
Most of the seemingly intractable problems would vanish into thin air. It would be like waking from a nightmare.
In accordance with the Fiscal Compact, member countries would be allowed to issue new Eurobonds only to replace maturing ones; after five years, the debts outstanding would be gradually reduced to 60% of GDP.
If a member country ran up additional debts, it could borrow only in its own name.
Admittedly, the Fiscal Compact needs some modifications to ensure that the penalties for noncompliance are automatic, prompt, and not too severe to be credible.
A tighter Fiscal Compact would practically eliminate the risk of default.
Thus, Eurobonds would not ruin Germany’s credit rating.
On the contrary, they would compare favorably with the bonds of the United States, the United Kingdom, and Japan.
To be sure, Eurobonds are not a panacea.
The boost derived from Eurobonds may not be sufficient to ensure recovery; additional fiscal and/or monetary stimulus may be needed.
But having such a problem would be a luxury.
More troubling, Eurobonds would not eliminate divergences in competitiveness.
Individual countries would still need to undertake structural reforms.
The EU would also need a banking union to make credit available on equal terms in every country.
(The Cyprus rescue made the need more acute by making the field even more uneven.)
But Germany’s acceptance of Eurobonds would transform the atmosphere and facilitate the needed reforms.
Unfortunately, Germany remains adamantly opposed to Eurobonds.
Since Chancellor Angela Merkel vetoed the idea, it has not been given any consideration.
The German public does not recognize that agreeing to Eurobonds would be much less risky and costly than continuing to do only the minimum to preserve the euro.
Germany has the right to reject Eurobonds.
But it has no right to prevent the heavily indebted countries from escaping their misery by banding together and issuing them.
If Germany is opposed to Eurobonds, it should consider leaving the euro.
Surprisingly, Eurobonds issued by a Germany-less Eurozone would still compare favorably with those of the US, UK, and Japanese bonds.
The reason is simple.
Because all of the accumulated debt is denominated in euros, it makes all the difference which country leaves the euro.
If Germany left, the euro would depreciate. The debtor countries would regain their competitiveness.
Their debt would diminish in real terms and, if they issued Eurobonds, the threat of default would disappear.
Their debt would suddenly become sustainable.
At the same time, most of the burden of adjustment would fall on the countries that left the euro.
Their exports would become less competitive, and they would encounter heavy competition from the rump eurozone in their home markets.
They would also incur losses on their claims and investments denominated in euros.
By contrast, if Italy left the eurozone, its euro-denominated debt burden would become unsustainable and would have to be restructured, plunging the global financial system into chaos.
So, if anyone must leave, it should be Germany, not Italy.
There is a strong case for Germany to decide whether to accept Eurobonds or leave the eurozone, but it is less obvious which of the two alternatives would be better for the country.
Only the German electorate is qualified to decide.
If a referendum in Germany were held today, the supporters of a eurozone exit would win hands down.
But more intensive consideration could change people’s mind.
They would discover that the cost to Germany of authorizing Eurobonds has been greatly exaggerated, and the cost of leaving the euro understated.
The trouble is that Germany has not been forced to choose.
It can continue to do no more than the minimum to preserve the euro.
This is clearly Merkel’s preferred choice, at least until after the next election.
Europe would be infinitely better off if Germany made a definitive choice between Eurobonds and a eurozone exit, regardless of the outcome; indeed, Germany would be better off as well.
The situation is deteriorating, and, in the longer term, it is bound to become unsustainable.
A disorderly disintegration resulting in mutual recriminations and unsettled claims would leave Europe worse off than it was when it embarked on the bold experiment of unification.
Surely that is not in Germany’s interest.

Asia’s Democratic Security Diamond
TOKYO – In the summer of 2007, addressing the Central Hall of the Indian Parliament as Japan’s prime minister, I spoke of the “Confluence of the Two Seas” – a phrase that I drew from the title of a book written by the Mughal prince Dara Shikoh in 1655 – to the applause and stomping approval of the assembled lawmakers. In the five years since then, I have become even more strongly convinced that what I said was correct.
Peace, stability, and freedom of navigation in the Pacific Ocean are inseparable from peace, stability, and freedom of navigation in the Indian Ocean.
Developments affecting each are more closely connected than ever.
Japan, as one of the oldest sea-faring democracies in Asia, should play a greater role in preserving the common good in both regions.
Yet, increasingly, the South China Sea seems set to become a “Lake Beijing,” which analysts say will be to China what the Sea of Okhotsk was to Soviet Russia: a sea deep enough for the People’s Liberation Army’s navy to base their nuclear-powered attack submarines, capable of launching missiles with nuclear warheads.
Soon, the PLA Navy’s newly built aircraft carrier will be a common sight – more than sufficient to scare China’s neighbors.
That is why Japan must not yield to the Chinese government’s daily exercises in coercion around the Senkaku Islands in the East China Sea.
True, only Chinese law-enforcement vessels with light weaponry, not PLA Navy ships, have entered Japan’s contiguous and territorial waters.
But this “gentler” touch should fool no one.
By making these boats’ presence appear ordinary, China seeks to establish its jurisdiction in the waters surrounding the islands as a fait accompli.
If Japan were to yield, the South China Sea would become even more fortified.
Freedom of navigation, vital for trading countries such as Japan and South Korea, would be seriously hindered.
The naval assets of the United States, in addition to those of Japan, would find it difficult to enter the entire area, though the majority of the two China seas is international water.
Anxious that such a development could arise, I spoke in India of the need for the Indian and Japanese governments to join together to shoulder more responsibility as guardians of navigational freedom across the Pacific and Indian oceans.
I must confess that I failed to anticipate that China’s naval and territorial expansion would advance at the pace that it has since 2007.
The ongoing disputes in the East China Sea and the South China Sea mean that Japan’s top foreign-policy priority must be to expand the country’s strategic horizons.
Japan is a mature maritime democracy, and its choice of close partners should reflect that fact.
I envisage a strategy whereby Australia, India, Japan, and the US state of Hawaii form a diamond to safeguard the maritime commons stretching from the Indian Ocean region to the western Pacific.
I am prepared to invest, to the greatest possible extent, Japan’s capabilities in this security diamond.
My opponents in the Democratic Party of Japan deserve credit for continuing along the path that I laid out in 2007; that is to say, they have sought to strengthen ties with Australia and India.
Of the two countries, India – a resident power in East Asia, with the Andaman and Nicobar Islands sitting at the western end of the Strait of Malacca (through which some 40% of world trade passes) – deserves greater emphasis.
Japan is now engaged in regular bilateral service-to-service military dialogues with India, and has embarked on official trilateral talks that include the US.
And India’s government has shown its political savvy by forging an agreement to provide Japan with rare earth minerals – a vital component in many manufacturing processes – after China chose to use its supplies of rare earths as a diplomatic stick.
I would also invite Britain and France to stage a comeback in terms of participating in strengthening Asia’s security.
The sea-faring democracies in Japan’s part of the world would be much better off with their renewed presence.
The United Kingdom still finds value in the Five Power Defense Arrangements with Malaysia, Singapore, Australia, and New Zealand.
I want Japan to join this group, gather annually for talks with its members, and participate with them in small-sized military drills.
Meanwhile, France’s Pacific Fleet in Tahiti operates on a minimal budget but could well punch above its weight.
That said, nothing is more important for Japan than to reinvest in its alliance with the US.
In a period of American strategic rebalancing toward the Asia-Pacific region, the US needs Japan as much as Japan needs the US.
Immediately after Japan’s earthquake, tsunami, and nuclear disaster in 2011, the US military provided for Japan the largest peacetime humanitarian relief operation ever mounted – powerful evidence that the 60-year bond that the treaty allies have nurtured is real.
Deprived of its time-honored ties with America, Japan could play only a reduced regional and global role.
I, for one, admit that Japan’s relationship with its biggest neighbor, China, is vital to the well-being of many Japanese.
Yet, to improve Sino-Japanese relations, Japan must first anchor its ties on the other side of the Pacific; for, at the end of the day, Japan’s diplomacy must always be rooted in democracy, the rule of law, and respect for human rights.
These universal values have guided Japan’s postwar development.
I firmly believe that, in 2013 and beyond, the Asia-Pacific region’s future prosperity should rest on them as well.

Transatlantic Trade for All
WASHINGTON, DC – The negotiations to create a Transatlantic Trade and Investment Partnership between the European Union and the United States are being widely welcomed.
British Prime Minister David Cameron has called the TTIP a “once-in-a-generation prize,” citing potential gains of £80 billion ($125.5 billion) each for the EU and the US and £85 billion for the rest of the world.
For a world weary of waiting for the World Trade Organization’s interminable Doha trade round to conclude, even a bilateral trade initiative may seem like a boon, especially when, as a recent Financial Times editorial pointed out, “bilateral”covers half of the world’s economy.
But there is a serious downside: The deal could hurt developing-country exporters, unless the EU and the US make a concerted effort to protect these actors’ interests.
The feature of the proposed pact that elicits the most excitement – its focus on regulatory barriers like mandatory product standards – should actually incite the greatest concern.
Given low tariffs in the EU and the US – less than 5%, on average – further preferential reductions will not seriously handicap outsiders.
But, when it comes to standards – such as those governing safety, health, and the environment – the market-access requirements are brutal and binary: either you meet the established standard or you do not sell.
As a result, third-country firms’ options will depend on how TTIP standards are established: through harmonization (adoption of a common standard) or mutual recognition (acceptance of goods that meet one another’s established standards).
The first option would enable producers everywhere to take advantage of economies of scale.
But, in some cases, the harmonized standard could be more stringent than some countries’ original standards.
Even though new standards would apply to suppliers from all exporting countries, compliance costs usually vary, meaning that those less equipped to meet higher standards could suffer.
In the late 1990’s, when the EU decided to harmonize standards for aflatoxins (a group of toxic compounds produced by certain molds), eight member states – including Italy, the Netherlands, and Spain – raised their national standards substantially, which is likely to have caused African exports of cereals, dried fruits, and nuts to Europe to decline by as much as$670 million.
With mutual recognition, the EU and the US would accept each other’s standards or conformity-assessment procedures, allowing firms to adhere to the less stringent requirements in each area.
If the policy were extended to third-country firms, it would have a powerful liberalizing impact.
For example, Malaysian television producers could choose to comply with, say, America’s easier-to-meet safety standards, then sell the same product in both markets, reaping the benefits of economies of scale while lowering compliance costs.
If, however, the TTIP excluded third-country firms from the mutual recognition policy, their competitiveness vis-à-vis European and American companies would diminish substantially.
Indeed, our research shows that when mutual-recognition agreements include restrictive rules of origin, intra-regional trade increases – at the expense of trade with other countries –and that developing countries tend to suffer most.
In fact, excessively constraining rules of origin have proved problematic for some of the EU’s previous recognition agreements, such as those governing professional-services standards.
While a Brazilian orange admitted for sale in Portugal can be sold throughout the EU, a Brazilian engineer or accountant licensed in Portugal must fulfill separate licensing requirements to work elsewhere in the EU, hampering much-needed labor mobility by forcing non-European workers to endure costly and inefficient bureaucratic procedures.
Furthermore, when it comes to tariffs and standards, WTO rules are not created equal.
While they protect countries excluded from bilateral or regional tariff agreements, thereby ensuring that integrated markets do not receive additional advantages, few safeguards exist to shield third countries from the fallout of agreements on mandatory standards.
Even in the absence of international rules, the EU and the US could take two actions to ensure that the TTIP does not have adverse consequences for developing economies.
First, they could allow all countries to reap the benefits of a bilateral mutual-recognition deal by agreeing not to impose restrictive rules of origin.
Second, where they do consider harmonization, they could favor the less stringent of the original standards, unless there is credible evidence that it would not support the relevant regulatory objective.
This is akin to a WTO test for departures from established international standards.
If the EU and the US made these two commitments, the rest of the world could follow the TTIP negotiations with hope, rather than trepidation.

Only the Poor Die Young
ROTTERDAM – People who are lower on the socioeconomic ladder (indicated by their level of education, occupation, or income) have shorter and less healthy lives, on average, than those on higher rungs.
Indeed, life expectancy at birth often varies by 5-10 years, depending on social and economic well-being, with poorer people spending 10-20 more years of life suffering from illness or disability than their wealthier counterparts.
In the nineteenth century, this situation would not have been surprising, given low average income, widespread poverty, and lack of social security.
But such data are commonly reported for high-income countries today, including those ranking high on indices of economic prosperity and human development – even Western Europe’s highly developed welfare states.
Since the end of World War II, Western European countries have tried to reduce socioeconomic inequality, or offset its consequences, through progressive taxation, social security programs, and a wide range of collectively financed provisions, such as public housing, education, health care, and cultural and leisure facilities.
But, while these policies have reduced inequalities in some social and economic outcomes, including income, housing quality, and health-care access, they have been insufficient to eliminate health inequalities.
Long-term time-series data indicate that the socioeconomic mortality gap narrowed before the 1950’s, but has grown substantially since then.
More puzzling is the fact that more generous welfare policies do not translate into smaller health disparities.
Even the Nordic countries – world leaders when it comes to creating universal and well-designed welfare policies that cover citizens from cradle to grave – face significant health disparities, despite their relatively low income inequality.
To be sure, modern welfare states have far from abolished social inequality, with disparities in access to material and human resources continuing to generate highly unequal lives among their citizens.
But the welfare state’s aim has never been radical redistribution of wealth.
Rather, welfare policies are intended to create a compromise between the interests of employees and employers, laborers and the middle classes.
As a result, their redistributive effects are modest.
So, while a partial failure of the welfare state may help to explain the persistence of health inequalities, one must look elsewhere to understand – and reverse – their rise.
Two possible explanations have emerged from the rapidly growing scientific literature on the subject: selective upward social mobility and delayed diffusion of behavioral change.
In reality, both factors are at work.
During the twentieth century, social mobility increased slowly but steadily in all high-income countries, with educational achievement and occupational status depending less on family background and more on cognitive ability and other personal characteristics.
As a result, the lower socioeconomic groups have not only shrunk in size, but have probably also become more homogeneous in terms of personal characteristics that increase the risk of health problems.
Moreover, people with a higher socioeconomic position tend to adopt new behaviors first, and to abandon more readily behaviors that are found to damage health, such as smoking and high-fat diets.
Given this, new behavioral recommendations by health authorities tend to exacerbate health inequalities, at least temporarily.
Significant disparities in smoking, physical exercise, diet, and alcohol consumption afflict many of Western Europe’s welfare states.
The welfare system, which was created to combat poverty, has been less effective against “diseases of affluence” like heart disease and lung cancer.
All of this highlights the need for creative solutions to disparities that unnecessarily and unfairly blight the lives of those who have the least, generate massive health-care costs, and pose a barrier to increased labor-force participation (impeding efforts in some countries to raise the retirement age).
In the last few decades, social policy in most Western European countries has moved away from redistribution.
This is a mistake, given that the consequences of this shift – rising income inequality, weaker social safety nets, and reduced health-care access – will aggravate health inequalities in the long run.
In fact, more, better-targeted re distributive policies, which account for the effects of selective upward social mobility and different rates of diffusion of behavioral change, are crucial to improving health outcomes in lower socioeconomic groups.
Income support should be complemented by preventive health programs, while health literacy programs could help to diminish the link between low cognitive ability and bad health.
Equal access to health care is not enough.
Reducing inequalities in health outcomes requires more intensive health care for patients in lower socioeconomic brackets, tailored to their specific needs and challenges.
For example, revenues from tobacco taxation, which disproportionately affects lower income groups, should be used to fund cessation-support programs that target disadvantaged smokers.
Significant and persistent health inequality indicates that, by raising the health levels of those with lower incomes or less education, massive strides could be made in improving populations’ overall health.
This may require reshaping the welfare system to some extent, but the payoff would be well worth the effort.

From Unemployment to Entrepreneurship
CHICAGO – It is well known that manufacturing employment has declined significantly in the United States, owing to the rise of manufacturing in developing countries like Mexico and China.
But few recognize similar drops in other sectors, despite such trends’ far-reaching economic, social, and political implications.
Since 1972, the number of telephone operators has fallen by 82%, typists by 80%, secretaries by 60%, and bookkeepers by 50%.
Moreover, during the Great Recession, office and administrative jobs declined by 8%, production and craft jobs fell by 17%, and the number of positions for machine operators, fabricators, and laborers dropped by 15%.
Employment in all other occupations either remained unchanged or grew.
Manufacturing occupations and administrative support used to employ millions.
But technological advances have enabled many of these middle-class jobs to be automated or moved offshore – a process that is expected to accelerate with growing automation of knowledge-based activities and advances in robotics.
In theory, workers can adapt to these changes by seeking employment in occupations that include non-routine tasks, which cannot be computerized or robotized (at least not in the foreseeable future).
These include highly paid positions like managers and technicians, as well as relatively low-paid jobs in protective and personal services, food preparation, and cleaning, but few “middle-skill” occupations.
As a result, the labor market is becoming increasingly polarized – a trend that many believe can be addressed with more and better education.
But a substantial proportion of cognitively capable people do not respond well to formal education and, even for those who do, it is inadequate to provide the insider knowledge and wide-ranging experience needed to adapt, much less innovate, in a dynamic labor market.
This shortcoming partly explains the prevalence of highly educated, unemployed young people worldwide.
Providing workers more options to enhance their knowledge and skills would enable them to capitalize on developing technologies, such as mobile Internet and social media, not only by filling positions at existing companies, but also by launching their own enterprises.
Indeed, self-employment is an increasingly attractive option for workers seeking some semblance of job security in an unpredictable and challenging labor market.
Given entrepreneurship’s potential to drive innovation and GDP growth, supporting such efforts is in everyone’s interest.
But commercial banks are reluctant to finance new ventures by unemployed workers with no collateral, making entrepreneurship a difficult path of labor-market adjustment in developed and developing countries alike.
In order to improve aspiring business owners’ prospects, some countries have begun to offer start-up subsidies to unemployed workers, sometimes in lieu of unemployment benefits.
But, while such policies help to reduce unemployment, their impact is subject to human-capital constraints, with many unemployed workers lacking the knowledge, experience, or confidence needed to launch a new venture.
Given this, start-up subsidies should be combined with subsidized entrepreneurial apprenticeships, like those that have provided training for masons, carpenters, plumbers, and electricians for decades (and, in some cases, for centuries).
Such apprenticeships would help workers acquire the experience and know-how that they need to take advantage of the opportunities afforded by technological progress.
For example, specialty-shop owners often find that doing business online is far more profitable than operating a brick-and-mortar store, because online retail expands the market for the knowledge contained in the products that they sell.
Similarly, the Internet is essential to the developing “sharing economy,” which includes car-sharing providers like Zipcar and I-Go, and accommodation-rental services like Airbnb and Zotel.
Such sharing-oriented businesses increase the productivity of existing capital, while creating new jobs for workers.
Initially, existing firms are likely to resist such apprenticeships, because investing time and resources in temporary workers – if not potential competitors – seems to conflict with their interests.
Of course, once an apprenticeship program is operational, the larger benefits implied by a more productive economy and lower unemployment will become apparent.
But getting there will require some convincing.
That is where governments come in.
With effective subsidy programs, governments can induce young, successful businesses that are exploiting recent developments in information technology and related fields to take on entrepreneurial apprentices.
Selecting innovative new firms, rather than established companies in traditional industries, is essential, not least because these are the firms that will provide most of the future employment growth.
Furthermore, these businesses are best suited to provide the relevant knowledge and experience for a start-up.
And, in the case of a family-owned business seeking a new proprietor, training an apprentice can be an effective way to pass on the relevant knowledge, as well as the firm’s assets.
Apprenticeships would facilitate the integration of younger workers into the labor force, while helping to correct skills mismatches among more experienced workers.
But an apprenticeship should not be confused with an unpaid internship.
Indeed, apprentices should be compensated at least at the minimum wage rate in a given occupation.
In addition to providing the funds for apprentices’ salaries, governments must monitor progress to ensure that apprentices are gaining valuable knowledge and experience.
At the end of a successful apprenticeship, a start-up subsidy should be available for aspiring entrepreneurs with good ideas and proven potential as business owners.
In a dynamic and unpredictable labor market, workers must be ready for anything.
Apprenticeships could not only help to boost human capital, lower unemployment, and increase labor productivity; they could also help to fuel the innovation and entrepreneurial spirit that ultimately drive economic growth and development.

My Best Investment
JAKARTA – When I was boy, I dreamed of becoming a doctor.
I was born in Indonesia in the early 1950’s, a time when most families in my country lacked access to health care.
As a result, thousands of children died each year from preventable diseases such as measles, polio, and malaria.
But revolutionary breakthroughs in medicine were starting to turn the tide on these killers, and Indonesia’s doctors were celebrated as heroes.
I wanted to be a hero, too, so I studied hard and enrolled in medical school.
My plans changed, however, when my father got ill.
He was a hard-working man who made pedicabs in Surabaya, and I left university when he could no longer manage the family business.
Ultimately, I became a successful entrepreneur and established a bank that is now one of Southeast Asia’s largest financial institutions.
Looking back, I have no regrets.
Indeed, I know that I have been incredibly blessed.
Millions of children in developing countries in Africa, Asia, and the Western Pacific are forced into extreme poverty when a parent gets sick or dies.
And millions more suffer from diseases that prevent them from leading a healthy and productive life.
That is why I have decided to invest $65 million in the Global Fund to Fight AIDS, Tuberculosis, and Malaria.
When the Global Fund was created a decade ago, HIV incidence was rising around the world, and the drugs used to treat the virus were still prohibitively expensive.
Malaria was killing one million people each year, with mortality concentrated among pregnant women and children under the age of five.
More than two million people were dying from tuberculosis, because they lacked access to low-cost, first-line treatment.
Since then, the Global Fund has played a key role in reversing the course of these epidemics.
Worldwide, HIV incidence has fallen by one-third, and the cost of HIV drugs has dropped more than 99%.
The number of African households that sleep under insecticide-treated bed nets has risen from 3% to 53%, and malaria deaths have fallen by one-third.
And TB mortality has dropped more than 40%.
Altogether, support provided by the Global Fund has saved more than nine million lives – a remarkable achievement.
But the impact of the Global Fund extends far beyond lives saved.
When an HIV-positive mother receives antenatal treatment so that her child can be born HIV-free, we change the future.
When a child is spared cerebral malaria and the lifelong mental disabilities that it can cause, new possibilities are created.
The world becomes a better place when we commit to giving our children a better start.
The Global Fund also plays a critical role in strengthening health care in developing countries.
Its resources have helped to train new generations of doctors, nurses, and technicians, while dramatically improving the overall quality of maternal and child health.
These investments are helping countries take direct ownership of the fight against infectious disease, ultimately reducing their dependence on foreign aid.
For example, support from the Global Fund has helped Indonesia, which has the world’s fourth-highest TB burden, develop an efficient and effective national TB-control program.
As a result, more than one million active cases have been successfully treated, while the incidence of the disease – which has cost Indonesia’s economy millions of dollars in lost productivity – has been driven down.
With technical support like this, Indonesia’s government is creating an affordable and sustainable national health-care system that will be fully financed with domestic resources by 2019.
I believe that the Global Fund is one of the smartest investments that we can make – as many governments have understood from the outset.
The United States has been the Global Fund’s largest supporter, but many others have done their part.
For example, Australia has provided US$410 million to the Global Fund since 2002, an amount that has enabled nearly 200,000 people to receive lifesaving HIV treatment, 80,000 people to receive TB treatment, seven million people to be cured of malaria, and 14 million bed nets to be delivered to families in need.
The Global Fund has brightened the futures of hundreds of thousands of children across Africa and Asia – a heroic achievement that should make donor countries’ citizens proud.
I hope that others with the means to support its work will invest so wisely.

East Asia’s Lessons for Africa
NEW YORK – On June 1-3, Japan is hosting the fifth meeting of TICAD, the Tokyo International Cooperation on African Development.
The meeting is a reminder that, while the rest of the world obsesses over Europe’s economic travails, America’s political paralysis, and the growth slowdown in China and other emerging markets, there remains a region – Sub-Saharan Africa – where poverty is almost the rule, not the exception.
From 1990 to 2010, the number of people living in poverty ($1.25 per day) across Sub-Saharan Africa rose from less than 300 million to nearly 425 million, while the number living on less than$2 a day grew from about 390 million to almost 600 million.
Still, the proportion of those living in poverty declined from 57% to 49% in this period. [See graph below.]
Developed countries have repeatedly broken their promises of aid or trade.
Yet Japan, still suffering from two decades of economic malaise, has somehow managed to remain actively engaged – not because of its strategic interests, but in order to meet a genuine moral imperative, namely that those who are better off should help those in need.
Africa today presents a mixed picture.
There are some notable successes – from 2007 to 2011, five of the world’s ten fastest-growing countries with a population of more than 10 million were in Africa.
And their progress has not been based solely on natural resources.
Among the best-performing countries have been Ethiopia, where GDP grew by roughly 10% annually in the five years ending in 2011, and Rwanda, Tanzania, and Uganda, where annual output has grown by more than 6% for a decade or more.
But, while some sources indicate that there are now more middle-class families in Africa (defined as having annual incomes in excess of $20,000) than in India, the continent also contains countries with the world’s highest levels of inequality.
Agriculture, on which so many of the poor depend, has not been doing well.
Yields per hectare have been stagnating.
Only 4% of arable and permanent cropland is irrigated, compared to 39% in South Asia and 29% in East Asia.
Fertilizer use in Africa amounts to just 13 kilograms per hectare, compared to 90 kilograms in South Asia and 190 kilograms in East Asia.
Most disappointing, even countries that have put their macroeconomic house in order and have made progress in governance have found it difficult to attract investment outside of the natural-resource sector.
Japan’s engagement is particularly important not only in terms of money and moral support, but also because Africa may learn something from East Asia’s development experience.
This may be particularly relevant today, with China’s rising wages and appreciating exchange rate underscoring rapid change in global comparative and competitive advantage.
Some manufacturing will move out of China, and Africa has a chance of capturing some fraction of it.
This is especially significant, given that, over the last 30 years, Sub-Saharan Africa has suffered from de-industrialization.
Indeed, by the late 2000’s – owing partly to the structural-adjustment policies pushed by the international financial institutions – manufacturing as a share of GDP in developing African economies was lower than it was in 1980.
But a manufacturing boom will not happen by itself.
African governments must undertake industrial policies to help restructure their economies.
Such policies have been controversial.
Some argue that government is not good at picking winners.
Some argue that it makes no difference whether a country produces potato chips or computer chips.
Both perspectives are misguided.
The purpose of such policies is to address well-known limitations in markets – for example, the important learning externalities, as skills relevant to one industry benefit nearby industries.
The goal of industrial policies is to identify these spillovers, and governments have done a very credible job in this respect.
In the United States, the government promoted agriculture in the nineteenth century; supported the first telegraph line (between Baltimore and Washington, demonstrated in 1844) and the first transcontinental line, thereby launching the telecommunications revolution; and then nurtured the Internet revolution.
Inevitably, government – through its infrastructure, laws and regulations (including taxation), and education system –shapes the economy.
For example, American tax and bankruptcy laws, combined with deregulation policies, effectively encouraged the creation of a hypertrophied financial sector.
With resources so scarce, developing countries cannot afford the luxury of such waste.
They have to think carefully about the future direction of their economies – about their dynamic comparative advantages.
The world’s most successful developing countries – those in East Asia – did just this, and among the lessons to be shared are those concerning how they conducted industrial policies at a time when their governments lacked the sophistication and depth of talent that they have today. 
Weaknesses in governance may affect the instruments of industrial policy, but not its use.
Japan has other lessons to teach as well.
Key elements of its development strategy – including its stress on education, equality, and land reform – are even more important today in Africa.
The world has changed markedly since East Asia began its remarkable developmental transition more than a half-century ago;and differences in history, institutions, and circumstances mean that policies must be adapted to local conditions.
But what is clear is that Japan and other East Asian countries followed a markedly different course from that recommended by the neo-liberal “Washington Consensus.”
Their policies worked; all too often, those of the Washington Consensus failed miserably.
African countries will benefit from reflecting on these successes and failures, and on what they mean for their own development strategies.

Diagnostics for Global Health
CORVALLIS, OREGON – In developed countries, most people take for granted that when they are sick, they will have access to timely diagnosis and treatment.
Indeed, while the diagnostic process – which typically involves sending a sample of blood, urine, or tissue to a laboratory for analysis – may be cumbersome and expensive, health-care providers and sophisticated laboratories remain widely available.
As a result, the disease burden in the developed world has declined substantially.
By contrast, in the developing world, millions of people die each year from treatable diseases like malaria, owing to the lack of sophisticated laboratories and alternative diagnostic tests.
But there is reason for hope: Advances in the field of microfluidics have the potential to transform health care by allowing “gold standard” laboratory-based testing to be transferred to the point of care (POC).
A POC test that provides an accurate and timely result would provide diagnostic access to underserved populations, enabling earlier treatment and helping to avoid mistreatment (treating another disease with similar symptoms).
In order to meet their potential, however, POC tests must account for the wide range of factors affecting health-care applications.
First, a POC test must meet the particular environmental and operating constraints of where it will be used.
These may include an unreliable power supply, harsh or unpredictable environmental conditions, limited contact time between the health-care provider and patient, lack of user training, severe price constraints, and inadequate local infrastructure, which can impede the maintenance and repair of relevant instruments.
Indeed, POC settings can vary from a semi-trained health-care provider working in a clinic with electricity and access to refrigeration to an untrained individual in an environment with no mechanism for controlling temperature or humidity.
In order to ensure the broadest coverage possible, POC tests should be designed to work in the settings with the fewest resources.
Likewise, POC tests must account for different tests’ requirements for clinical utility.
While diagnosing malaria requires only a positive or negative result, an HIV viral-load test would need to provide a graded output indicating the amount of virus detected.
One of the most successful POC test formats is that of the well-known pregnancy test, which requires only the user’s urine and takes roughly 15 minutes to deliver the result.
This class of “rapid diagnostic tests” (RDTs), which are also used for infectious diseases like malaria and HIV, satisfy many of the key requirements for global health applications: they are fast and inexpensive, can be conducted easily by an untrained user, and do not require refrigeration.
But they lack the sensitivity to provide adequate diagnostic information for many health conditions.
Given this, researchers are working to develop more sophisticated paper-based tests.
For example, a new class of device, about the size of a postage stamp, that splits a sample into multiple zones with different detection chemistries has been used to test multiple conditions associated with liver failure in HIV and tuberculosis patients.
And “paper network” devices include built-in timing mechanisms to enable automated multi-step tests like those used in laboratories, but in a disposable format.
Another mechanism for expanding the capabilities of diagnostic testing would take advantage of the penetration of mobile-phone networks in developing countries.
RDTs are largely limited to applications that require visual interpretation.
A non-dedicated mobile phone could be used to capture and send image data from an RDT to a remote site, where a health-care provider would provide feedback on the results.
But implementing such a program raises a new set of challenges.
In order to ensure accurate test results, the variability of camera positioning by the user and lighting conditions indifferent test environments must be addressed. (One promising approach under development would use an adapter to connect then on-dedicated mobile phone to the RDT.)
Moreover, a phone-based test would require software infrastructure, such as communication protocols and prioritization procedures, to coalesce with the health-care system.
And the compatibility issues raised by the wide variety of mobile-phone handsets would need to be addressed.
Finally, the successful deployment of non-dedicated phone-based testing would require acceptance from the medical establishment.
The US Food and Drug Administration’s recent approval of several medical devices supported by dedicated phone-based readers is a promising step.
Effective POC tests are being developed; the proliferation of mobile phones will further augment the capabilities of these tests.
These emergent capabilities promise to extend the reach of high-quality diagnostics to remote populations, improve health management, and reduce health-care costs everywhere.

Europe’s Short Vacation
NEW YORK – Since last November, the European Central Bank, under its new president, Mario Draghi, has reduced its policy rate sand undertaken two injections of more than €1 trillion of liquidity into the eurozone banking system.
This led to a temporary reduction in the financial strains confronting the debt endangered countries on the eurozone’s periphery (Greece, Spain, Portugal, Italy, and Ireland), sharply lowered the risk of a liquidity run in the eurozone banking system, and cut financing costs for Italy and Spain from their unsustainable levels of last fall.
At the same time, a technical default by Greece was avoided, and the country implemented a successful – if coercive –restructuring of its public debt.
A new fiscal compact – and new governments in Greece, Italy, and Spain – spurred hope of credible commitment to austerity and structural reform.
And the decision to combine the eurozone’s new bailout fund (the European Stability Mechanism) with the old one (the European Financial Stability Facility) significantly increased the size of the eurozone’s firewall.
But the ensuing honeymoon with the markets turned out to be brief.
Interest-rate spreads for Italy and Spain are widening again, while borrowing costs for Portugal and Greece remained high all along.
And, inevitably, the recession on the eurozone’s periphery is deepening and moving to the core, namely France and Germany.
Indeed, the recession will worsen throughout this year, for many reasons.
First, front-loaded fiscal austerity – however necessary –is accelerating the contraction, as higher taxes and lower government spending and transfer payments reduce disposable income and aggregate demand.
Moreover, as the recession deepens, resulting in even wider fiscal deficits, another round of austerity will be needed.
And now, thanks to the fiscal compact, even the eurozone’s core will be forced into front-loaded recessionary austerity.
Moreover, while über-competitive Germany can withstand a euro at – or even stronger than – $1.30, for the eurozone’s periphery, where unit labor costs rose 30-40% during the last decade, the value of the exchange rate would have to fall to parity with the US dollar to restore competitiveness and external balance.
After all, with painful deleveraging – spending less and saving more to reduce debts – depressing domestic private and public demand, the only hope of restoring growth is an improvement in the trade balance, which requires a much weaker euro.
Meanwhile, the credit crunch in the eurozone periphery is intensifying: thanks to the ECB long-term cheap loans, banks there don’t have a liquidity problem now, but they do have a massive capital shortage.
Faced with the difficulty of meeting their 9% capital-ratio requirement, they will achieve the target by selling assets and contracting credit – not exactly an ideal scenario for economic recovery.
To make matters worse, the eurozone depends on oil import seven more than the United States does, and oil prices are rising, even as the political and policy environment is deteriorating.
France may elect a president who opposes the fiscal compact and whose policies may scare the bond markets.
Elections in Greece – where the recession is turning into a depression – may give 40-50% of the popular vote to parties that favor immediate default and exit from the eurozone.
Irish voters may reject the fiscal compact in a referendum.
And there are signs of austerity and reform fatigue both in Spain and Italy, where demonstrations, strikes, and popular resentment against painful austerity are mounting.
Even structural reforms that will eventually increase productivity growth can be recessionary in the short run.
Increasing labor-market flexibility by reducing the costs of shedding workers will lead – in the short run – to more layoffs in the public and private sector, exacerbating the fall in incomes and demand.
Finally, after a good start, the ECB has now placed on hold the additional monetary stimulus that the eurozone needs.
Indeed, ECB officials are starting to worry aloud about the rise in inflation due to the oil shock.
The trouble is that the eurozone has an austerity strategy but no growth strategy.
And, without that, all it has is a recession strategy that makes austerity and reform self-defeating, because, if output continues to contract, deficit and debt ratios will continue to rise to unsustainable levels.
Moreover, the social and political backlash eventually will become overwhelming.
That is why interest-rate spreads in the eurozone periphery are widening again now. The peripheral countries suffer from severe stock and flow imbalances.
The stock imbalances include large and rising public and private debt as a share of GDP. The flow imbalances include a deepening recession, massive loss of external competitiveness, and the large external deficits that markets are now unwilling to finance.
Without a much easier monetary policy and a less front-loaded mode of fiscal austerity, the euro will not weaken, external competitiveness will not be restored, and the recession will deepen.
And, without resumption of growth – not years down the line, but in 2012 – the stock and flow imbalances will become even more unsustainable.
More eurozone countries will be forced to restructure their debts, and eventually some will decide to exit the monetary union.
